#	Process a document using the (new) Document Processing System

### Find out where this command came from:
#	Resort to a kludge to get around the fact that "type foo"
#	returns something like "foo is xxx", but "type -p foo" is
#	not supported on Solaris.

### May break if classpath is not set appropriately.

    echo "Please put the PIA's binary directory in your $PATH"

### Handle -v specially: 
#	it has to be the first option in order for pia_wrapper to see it.

if [ "$1" = "-v" ] ; then
    V="-v"
    shift
fi

# We will count on Pia to handle multiple occurrances of -root and -u,
#	so that arguments provided by the user will override anything
#	this script puts earlier in the argument list.
