<h1>To-Do list: WOAD</h1>

<ol>
  <li> <b>Hole</b> linking of identifiers to annotation <br />
       This requires two things:  proper tagging of identifiers in context,
       and figuring out where in the tree to link them.  Generally, each
       identifier gets its own page, Wiki style.  In some cases the context
       requires its own page, i.e. for Java identifiers or XHTML tags.

  <li> <b>Bug</b> can't set targetServer in a subdirectory.<br />
       Need to match and remove a prefix, let's say maybe
       <code>SITE:documentOffset</code>. The parameter to set this would then
       be <code>offset=<em>path</em></code>.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> annotation tagset. <br />

  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-07 <b>Hole</b> Do a _subsite.xcf file for standalone Woad <br />
       i.e. an Apache's document root.  This may be simpler than the PIA
       version, but will still involve bug fixes to make the top-level
       <code>/Woad</code> directory work for tagsets and so on.  Of course,
       could put <code>src-*.ts</code> in <code>PIA/lib</code> for now.

  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-07 <b>Hole</b> (dps) wrappers, #element, #type in tagsets <br />
       Need to define wrapper element and default bindings for #element,
       #comment, etc.  Default element is handled differently from other node
       types, which have to be rewrapped as elements by the parser.
       GenericHandler has to operate differently for non-elements.

       -- (element="", documentWrapper, element="#type" 2000-06-05)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (site) <code>file:</code> in <code>.xcf</code> file <br />
       Need to be able to make virtual links to absolute paths.  There
       has to be some kind of restriction to prevent security holes.
       Possibly restrict to normal user, not <code>pia</code>; also perhaps
       make the resulting subtrees non-trusted.

  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (site) override config file name <br />
       Need to be able to override <code>_subsite.xcf</code> as the default
       configuration file name in subsites.  Currently, configFileName is only
       in Site.
       (2000-05-30)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (site) re-read config file <br />
       Need to be able to re-read the subsite config file in order to make
       changes to projects.
       (2000-05-30)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (pia) make PIA namespace available to config files <br />
       Configuration files need to be read with the PIA: namespace in effect. 
       (2000-05-30)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Hole</b> make Woad: namespace available in subs. <br />
       It turns out that what you need is <code>&amp;Woad:path;</code> for the
       path to wherever Woad's home directory is.  It gets used for forms, for
       example.
