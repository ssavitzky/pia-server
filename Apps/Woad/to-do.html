<h1>To-Do list: WOAD</h1>

<ol>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> directories in URL-space cause havoc <br />
       The mapping from url to various local paths is badly broken.  In
       particular, because you can't reliably tell if the last component is a
       directory, you can't reliably identify the base for fixing up relative
       references.  An "isDirectory" flag in the annotations will help.  Be
       nice if you could get redirects from the server.  Can also look in the
       sources -- that's totally reliable if a corresponding source directory
       exists.

  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> fix command-line decoding <br />
       Check for presence of target, sources; set <code>vroot</code>
       appropriately.  It may be feasible to do it in <code>woad.xcf</code>.
       (2000-06-23)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (site) defining namespace in config file loses <br />
       Ends up with <code>.source</code> non-existant.  Weird.
       (2000-06-23)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Hole</b> linking of identifiers to annotation, docs. <br />
       This requires two things: proper tagging of identifiers in context,
       and figuring out where in the tree to link them.  Generally, each
       identifier gets its own page, Wiki style.  In some cases the
       context requires its own page, i.e. for Java identifiers or XHTML
       tags.
       (2000-06-07)<br />
       -- (2000-06-28: annotation listing done.  Ready for indexing and
	  linking.)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> allow arbitrary source=target mapping using index <br />
       either a separate file, or something in <code>dirIndex</code>.  Needed
       for stuff like <code>/cgi-bin</code>
       (2000-06-23)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> Allow arbitrary links, text on index bar <br />
       This requires using &lt;xan&gt; etc. tags, with some modifications.
       (2000-06-22)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Hole</b> regenerate source dirIndex incrementally <br />
       can perhaps be done by invoking the perl script as a CGI.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> don't index last component of path in decoratePath <br />
       A little tricky.  Either count first, or stay one step behind and add
       an end marker.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> (pia) optional redirect on extension path <br />
       Optionally redirect on locating a document with an extension supplied
       from the path.
       (2000-06-22)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (site) <code>locate</code> should fix pathinfo <br />
       <code>locate</code> needs to chop ``<code>.</code>'' and
       ``<code>..</code>'' segments from the pathinfo before passing it to the
       listing document.
       (2000-06-22)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> support for woadProject under root <br />
       (subdirectory of <code>~/.woad</code>) to allow multiple WOAD servers to
       keep out of one anothers' way. -- it would also provide an alternative
       to [TOP].
       (2000-06-21)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Wish</b> support for multiple source directories <br />
       <code>woad-index.pl</code> needs to take multiple source files.
       (2000-06-21)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> prefixes not robust <br />
       Need to explicitly force prefixes to have or not have leading slash.
       (2000-06-16)<br />
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (site) <code>file:</code> in <code>.xcf</code> file <br />
       Need to be able to make virtual links to absolute paths, and it works,
       but there ought to be some kind of restriction to prevent security holes.
       Possibly restrict to normal user, not <code>pia</code>; also perhaps
       make the resulting subtrees non-trusted.
       (2000-05-30)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (site) override config file name <br />
       Need to be able to override <code>_subsite.xcf</code> as the default
       configuration file name in subsites.  Currently, configFileName is only
       in Site.
       (2000-05-30)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (site) re-read config file <br />
       Need to be able to re-read the subsite config file in order to make
       changes to projects.
       (2000-05-30)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (pia) make PIA namespace available to config files <br />
       Configuration files need to be read with the PIA: namespace in effect.
       It's actually more subtle: a Site under construction has to read its
       own site-config file (oops).  It's not an issue if it's just using the
       default <code>_subsite.xcf</code>.
       (2000-05-30)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Hole</b> make Woad: namespace available in subs. <br />
       It turns out that what you need is <code>&amp;Woad:path;</code> for the
       path to wherever Woad's home directory is.  It gets used for forms, for
       example. 
  </li>
