<h1>To-Do list: WOAD</h1>

<ol>
  <li> <b>Hole</b> linking of identifiers to annotation, docs. <br />
       This requires two things:  proper tagging of identifiers in context,
       and figuring out where in the tree to link them.  Generally, each
       identifier gets its own page, Wiki style.  In some cases the context
       requires its own page, i.e. for Java identifiers or XHTML tags.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> WOAD directory listings. <br />
       In order to make WOAD-based directory listings we need to either map -
       into a web page, or make sure there's a default woad-index.wh in every
       directory.

  <li> <b>Bug</b> (site) <code>file:</code> in <code>.xcf</code> file <br />
       Need to be able to make virtual links to absolute paths.  There
       has to be some kind of restriction to prevent security holes.
       Possibly restrict to normal user, not <code>pia</code>; also perhaps
       make the resulting subtrees non-trusted.

  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (site) override config file name <br />
       Need to be able to override <code>_subsite.xcf</code> as the default
       configuration file name in subsites.  Currently, configFileName is only
       in Site.

  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (site) re-read config file <br />
       Need to be able to re-read the subsite config file in order to make
       changes to projects.
       (2000-05-30)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (pia) make PIA namespace available to config files <br />
       Configuration files need to be read with the PIA: namespace in effect. 
       (2000-05-30)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Hole</b> make Woad: namespace available in subs. <br />
       It turns out that what you need is <code>&amp;Woad:path;</code> for the
       path to wherever Woad's home directory is.  It gets used for forms, for
       example.
