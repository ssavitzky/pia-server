<h1>To-Do list: WOAD</h1>

<ol>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> Navigation buttons in index files <br />
       Implement as part of the wrapper element.  See, e.g., the <a
       href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/">Jargon File</a>.
       (2000-08-28)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> query form of word lookup breaks index links <br />
       (but notes are OK) This probably breaks indexing in source code,
       too.  The right way to handle word queries is redirect, but PIA can't
       do that yet.
       (2000-08-25)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> save startup parameters <br />
       The <code>woad</code> command should save its command line in the root;
       then <code>woad&nbsp;<em>root</em></code> should restart it.  Implies
       that the filename parameter should be always (usually?) be the root.
       (2000-08-24)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> other word sources <br />
       Some locations are too big to index.  Jargon file is marginal.  Online
       dictionaries like <a href="http://www.m-w.com/">Merriam-Webster</a> are
       simply out of the question, but we want to offer them in
       <code>/.word</code>.  The list needs to be extensible.
       (2000-08-21)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> shallow parsing <br />
       <a href="ftp://fas.sfu.ca/pub/cs/TR/1998/CMPT1998-17.html">REX: XML
       Shallow Parsing with Regular Expressions</a> provides the regexp needed
       to mark up an XML file as a listing.  OTOH it's within epsilon of what
       we're already doing in AbstractParser.
       (2000-08-11) 
  </li>
  <li> <b>Wish</b> Rating, sorting, and filtering on notes <br />
       Suggestion from Amy Bruckman.  You'd like to be able to filter or sort
       on like author, date, author's or note's rating in any of several
       dimensions, etc.
       (2000-08-10) 
  </li>
  <li> <b>Wish</b> Aribtrary metadata in notes <br />
       Suggestion from Amy Bruckman.
       (2000-08-10) 
  </li>
  <li> <b>Wish</b> Store notes using CVS <br />
       Would provide for versioning and recovery from both unintentional
       damage and intentional vandalism.  Could also be used for other
       historical metadata and for sharing annotation among widely-separated
       sites.  Also allows for e-mail notification.  Suggestion from Amy
       Bruckman. 
       (2000-08-10) 
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> preference-based ordering for sections <br />
       Can probably link this with the &lt;toolbar&gt; tag somehow; the idea
       is that your profile specifies the order and selection for notes,
       cross-references, source code, etc.
       (2000-08-10) 
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> Listings in <code>.words</code> don't list files!<br />
       They should at least <em>offer</em> the complete listing, and by
       default provide a subset.
       (2000-08-10)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> subdirectory listings confused if prefix="" <br />
       If the sourcePrefix is null, WOAD can't find index files in
       subdirectories (but does find them at the top level).  Links, however,
       are correct.
       (2000-08-10)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Hole</b> mappings to <em>arbitrary</em> other servers <br />
       Keep lists of URLs mapped to site, source, and word trees, with
       optional mapping code (e.g. for forming queries).  Allows totally
       general use of, e.g., indexers and viewers.  And of course there's
       <code>file:/&amp;sourceRoot;/</code> for raw views.
       (2000-08-10)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> xref C code using LXR <br />
       Why re-invent the wheel? <a href="http://lxr.linux.no/">LXR</a> looks
       great, and it's in PERL.  GPL.  Doesn't grok Makefile, html or perl,
       though. 
       (2000-08-07)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> Full-text source indexing <br />
       <a href="http://webglimpse.org/">Glimpse</a> is what
       <a href="http://lxr.linux.no/">LXR</a> uses.  Unfortunately it's
       free only to nonprofits.  An earlier version
       (4.0) was free; may be available from the CVS tree.  See
       <a href="http://ls6.cs.uni-dortmund.de/ir/projects/freeWAIS-sf/">
       FreeWAIS-sf</a> for a possible alternative.  The original
       <a href="ftp://ftp.cnidr.org/pub/NIDR.tools/freewais/">FreeWAIS</a>
       doesn't seem to have been worked on since 1996.  List of full-text
       indexers in <a href="http://dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Information_Retrieval/Fulltext/">DMOZ</a>.
       <a href="http://sunsite.Berkeley.EDU/SWISH-E/">SWISH-E</a> also possible.
       <a href="http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/code/97/16/index2a.html">
       This article</a> has useful info about doing it in PERL.  Turns out
       that Swish and Glimpse are what Harvest calls "brokers" and BOTH are
       included in the Harvest distro.  But the Glimpse in the current Harvest
       distro is still non-free.
       (2000-08-07)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> Full-text site indexing <br />
       <a href="http://www.tardis.ed.ac.uk/harvest/">Harvest</a> was
       originally associated with Glimpse, but seems still to be free.  OTOH
       there are plenty of crawlers around, including one in
       <a href="http://sunsite.Berkeley.EDU/SWISH-E/">SWISH-E</a>, which is
       mentioned in the Harvest archives as a faster alternative to glimpse.
       See also <a href="http://webharvest.sourceforge.net/ng/">harvest-ng</a>
       which is in perl rather than C.
       (2000-08-07)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> do we need <code>/.doc</code>? <br />
       Isomorphic to <code>/.source</code> but showing HTML documents as they
       are rather than marked up as source, though presumably <em>with</em>
       the Woad wrappers.  Possibly called <code>.direct</code> instead of
       <code>.doc</code>.  Source files would be shown through a documentation
       extractor (e.g. tsdoc).  The idea being that you could view
       documentation embedded in the code, and view the code as documentation,
       and have links in the documentation work (right now they don't; you end
       up looking at the listing and have to click to change the format).
       Requires redefining &lt;a&gt; to fix local links.  May be able to do
       this with just a tagset.
       (2000-08-04)<br />
       -- Do <em>not</em> need it: just fix up links in the source listing to
	  carry current format info.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Hole</b> need CVS interface <br />
       See <a href="http://stud.fh-heilbronn.de/~zeller/cgi/cvsweb.cgi/">
       cvsweb</a> and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/bonsai.html"> Bonsai </a>.
       (2000-07-31)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> suppress .wl extension in source listings <br />
       <code>.wl</code> is used for pre-formatted or annotated listings.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> Authors and user preferences <br />
       Probably cookies are the simplest implementation.
       (2000-07-20)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> standard wordlists in PIA/Apps/Woad <br />
       Possibly aliased in rather than directly in Woad/.word, but in any case
       we should index such standard sources as the <a
       href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/">Jargon File</a>, Sun's Java
       documentation, the Apache manual, PHP, Perl, HTML, and so on.  It
       should be easy to map lists in and out depending on the target app.
       Jargon index is <a
       href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/The-Jargon-Lexicon.html"
       >here</a> with sub-indices like <a
       href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/-A-.html">-A-</a>
       (2000-07-20)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> don't follow links to directories when indexing. <br />
       Sometimes you need to, but in most cases this will just get you into
       trouble.  One alternative might be to check dates on dirIndex files;
       another might be to keep a database of visited directories and
       abspaths. 
       (2000-07-20)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> frameset with WOAD controls <br />
       Assuming you can tell what page is being displayed, you can add
       controls that go to the corresponding WOAD server page.
       (2000-07-19)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> directories in URL-space cause havoc <br />
       The mapping from url to various local paths is badly broken.  In
       particular, because you can't reliably tell if the last component is a
       directory, you can't reliably identify the base for fixing up relative
       references.  An "isDirectory" flag in the annotations will help.  Be
       nice if you could get redirects from the server.  Can also look in the
       sources -- that's totally reliable if a corresponding source directory
       exists.
       (2000-06-23)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> fix command-line decoding <br />
       Check for presence of target, source; set <code>vroot</code>
       appropriately.  It may be feasible to do it in <code>woad.xcf</code>.
       (2000-06-23)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (site) defining namespace in config file loses <br />
       Ends up with <code>.source</code> non-existant.  Weird.
       (2000-06-23)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Hole</b> linking of identifiers to annotation, docs. <br />
       This requires two things: proper tagging of identifiers in context,
       and figuring out where in the tree to link them.  Generally, each
       identifier gets its own page, Wiki style.  In some cases the
       context requires its own page, i.e. for Java identifiers or XHTML
       tags.
       (2000-06-07)<br />
       -- (2000-06-28: annotation listing done.  Ready for indexing and
	  linking.)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> allow arbitrary source=target mapping using index <br />
       either a separate file, or something in <code>dirIndex</code>.  Needed
       for stuff like <code>/cgi-bin</code>
       (2000-06-23)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> Allow arbitrary links, text on index bar <br />
       This requires using &lt;xan&gt; etc. tags, with some modifications.
       (2000-06-22)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Hole</b> regenerate source dirIndex incrementally <br />
       can perhaps be done by invoking the perl script as a CGI.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> don't index last component of path in decoratePath <br />
       A little tricky.  Either count first, or stay one step behind and add
       an end marker.
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> (pia) optional redirect on extension path <br />
       Optionally redirect on locating a document with an extension supplied
       from the path.
       (2000-06-22)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (site) <code>locate</code> should fix pathinfo <br />
       <code>locate</code> needs to chop ``<code>.</code>'' and
       ``<code>..</code>'' segments from the pathinfo before passing it to the
       listing document.
       (2000-06-22)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> support for woadProject under root <br />
       (subdirectory of <code>~/.woad</code>) to allow multiple WOAD servers to
       keep out of one anothers' way. -- it would also provide an alternative
       to [TOP].
       (2000-06-21)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Wish</b> support for multiple source directories <br />
       <code>woad-index.pl</code> needs to take multiple source files.
       (2000-06-21)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> prefixes not robust <br />
       Need to explicitly force prefixes to have or not have leading slash.
       (2000-06-16)<br />
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (site) <code>file:</code> in <code>.xcf</code> file <br />
       Need to be able to make virtual links to absolute paths, and it works,
       but there ought to be some kind of restriction to prevent security holes.
       Possibly restrict to normal user, not <code>pia</code>; also perhaps
       make the resulting subtrees non-trusted.
       (2000-05-30)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (site) override config file name <br />
       Need to be able to override <code>_subsite.xcf</code> as the default
       configuration file name in subsites.  Currently, configFileName is only
       in Site.
       (2000-05-30)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (site) re-read config file <br />
       Need to be able to re-read the subsite config file in order to make
       changes to projects.
       (2000-05-30)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (pia) make PIA namespace available to config files <br />
       Configuration files need to be read with the PIA: namespace in effect.
       It's actually more subtle: a Site under construction has to read its
       own site-config file (oops).  It's not an issue if it's just using the
       default <code>_subsite.xcf</code>.
       (2000-05-30)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Hole</b> make Woad: namespace available in subs. <br />
       It turns out that what you need is <code>&amp;Woad:path;</code> for the
       path to wherever Woad's home directory is.  It gets used for forms, for
       example.
