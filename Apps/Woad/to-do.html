<h1>To-Do list: WOAD</h1>

<ol>
  <li> <b>Hole</b> linking of identifiers to annotation, docs. <br />
       This requires two things: proper tagging of identifiers in context,
       and figuring out where in the tree to link them.  Generally, each
       identifier gets its own page, Wiki style.  In some cases the
       context requires its own page, i.e. for Java identifiers or XHTML
       tags.

  <li> <b>Bug</b> prefixes not robust <br />
       Need to explicitly force prefixes to have or not have leading slash.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> annotation tagset. <br />

  <li> <b>Bug</b> (site) <code>file:</code> in <code>.xcf</code> file <br />
       Need to be able to make virtual links to absolute paths, and it works,
       but there ought to be some kind of restriction to prevent security holes.
       Possibly restrict to normal user, not <code>pia</code>; also perhaps
       make the resulting subtrees non-trusted.

  <li> <b>Bug</b> (site) override config file name <br />
       Need to be able to override <code>_subsite.xcf</code> as the default
       configuration file name in subsites.  Currently, configFileName is only
       in Site.
       (2000-05-30)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (site) re-read config file <br />
       Need to be able to re-read the subsite config file in order to make
       changes to projects.
       (2000-05-30)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> (pia) make PIA namespace available to config files <br />
       Configuration files need to be read with the PIA: namespace in effect.
       It's actually more subtle: a Site under construction has to read its
       own site-config file (oops).  It's not an issue if it's just using the
       default <code>_subsite.xcf</code>.

  </li>
  <li> <b>Hole</b> make Woad: namespace available in subs. <br />
       It turns out that what you need is <code>&amp;Woad:path;</code> for the
       path to wherever Woad's home directory is.  It gets used for forms, for
       example. 
  </li>
