<h3>Abstract:</h3>

<blockquote>
<p> This document describes the structures and interfaces of the <font face="sans-serif">WOAD</font> system at the level required for extending
    and customizing it.  The intended audience is web-page and software
    developers -- its purpose is both to help you integrate <font face="sans-serif">WOAD</font> into an existing suite of applications, and
    to help you make existing applications and documentation (such as
    cross-indexers, pretty-printers, and web-accessible reference material)
    useful in the <font face="sans-serif">WOAD</font> environment.
</p>
<p> The structures and interfaces described here correspond loosely to the
    data structures and application programming interfaces of a conventional
    but customizable software application (EMACS is perhaps the classic
    example).  <em>However,</em> <font face="sans-serif">WOAD</font> is a
    <em>web</em> application, not a word processor or software development kit
    -- the structures and interfaces described here are for the most part such
    things as directory structures, file formats, XML schemata, and naming
    conventions.

<h2> <a name="section-1">1:</a> The <font face="sans-serif">WOAD</font> Tree</h2>

<dl>
  <dt> <b>Note:</b> Watch out for empty files in Woad's annotation directories.
  </dt>
  <dd> If somebody has done, e.g., <code>touch&nbsp;~/.pia/.words/foo</code>
       and you later ask for <code>/.words/foo</code> you get a ``document
       contains no data'' error, which is perfectly correct but potentially
       confusing, especially in <code>.words</code> where you're expecting a
       directory listing.  This can easily happen if someone is ``playing
       around'' in the annotation directories, creating files just to see what
       happens.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="section-1.1">1.1:</a> The <code>.notes</code> subtree</h3>

<p> The ``subtree'' that contains Woad's page (URL) annotations has by far the
    simplest structure:  every URL on the server corresponds to a
    <em>directory</em> in the <code>.notes</code> subtree that contains the
    annotations for that URL.  Note that this is true even if the URL
    corresponds to an ordinary file with an extension:  the annotation for
    <code>/.../foo.html</code> will be contained in a <em>directory</em>
    called <code>/.notes/.../foo.html/</code>.
</p>

<p> There's only one additional ``catch'' -- most Woad servers don't use the
    prefix <code>/.notes</code>: the root of the annotation tree <em>is</em>
    the root of the Woad web server.  This makes for a particularly trivial
    mapping between target URL's and Woad annotation URL's: just change the
    server name.  If the Woad and target servers are on the same machine, it's
    even easier: just change the port number.
</p>

<p> There are two exceptions to this.  The first is for applications where the
    Woad annotations are <em>on the same server as the target.</em> (This is
    true of the PIA, for example; it might also be done on an intranet.)  The
    second is for Woad trees that don't correspond to a web application at all
    -- for example, you might be using Woad as a directory-tree browser with
    annotations.  This second technique allows Woad to be added to
    <em>any</em> development environment.
</p>

<h3><a name="section-1.2">1.2:</a> The <code>.source</code> subtree</h3>

<p> Things are slightly more complex in the <code>.source</code> subtree,
    because it effectively ``overlays'' the actual source directory tree -- a
    URL of <code>.source/.../foo.html</code> is supposed to retrieve the
    source listing of <code>foo.html</code>, and this is done by actually
    <em>retrieving</em> <code>foo.html</code> and marking it up on the fly.
</p>

<p> Underneath it all there are two parallel directory trees: one under the
    Woad server's document root (typically <code>~/.woad</code> for a personal
    Woad server running on Unix), making the source annotation directory
    <code>~/.woad/.source</code>, and one under the <em>source</em> root,
    passed to the Woad server on the command line with the
    <code>source=<em>path</em></code> option.  Whenever a URL starting with
    <code>/.source</code> is requested, the Woad server looks in <em>both</em>
    places: first under its own root, then under the source root.
</p>

<p> Hence, annotations for <code>foo.html</code> have to be contained in a
    special <code>.notes</code> subdirectory of the annotation directory that
    corresponds to <code>foo.html</code>'s <em>parent directory</em>.  This
    could also have been done for directories (putting the annotations for
    the source directory <code>.../bar/</code> under the annotation directory
    <code>.../bar/.notes/</code>), but it wasn't.
</p>

<p> One advantage of this seemingly clumsy arrangement is that the necessary
    index files, and even Woad annotations, can be prepackaged and shipped
    with the source files of a Woad-aware web application.  The biggest
    advantage, though, is that it lets the Woad server format HTML and XML
    source files by simply redefining the tags, in effect applying a (rather
    drastic) stylesheet-like transformation to them.
</p>

<p> In fact, Woad goes farther still: it handles <em>other</em> languages, for
    example Perl and C, by parsing them into the same internal representation
    used by the XML and HTML parsers and then applying essentially the same
    set of style transformations.
</p>

<p> Finally, some Woad administrators may choose to eliminate the distinction
    between source tree and source <em>annotation</em> tree, and keep the
    annotations directly in the sources all the time.  This is <em>not
    recommended</em> when there are multiple developers and each developer has
    their own complete working copy of the source code (under a version
    control system like CVS) -- in this case it's better to share the
    annotations but keep the code separate.  It <em>does</em> work when
    everyone is working in the same source tree, and a version control system
    like RCS is used to lock the files being edited. 
</p>

<p> Eventually we hope to support multiple developers by allowing both private
    (individual) and public (shared) notes, but implementing this will require
    significant extensions to the PIA's site-structure package.
</p>


<h3><a name="section-1.3">1.3:</a> The <code>.word</code> subtree</h3>

<p> The characters permitted in WOAD words are the same as those permitted in
    XML tagnames and identifiers.  A WOAD word may contain the characters
    ``<code>_</code>'' (underscore), ``<code>-</code>'' (hyphen), and
    ``<code>.</code> (period)'' in addition to letters and digits.  Hence 
    identifiers in most programming-languages can be treated as words.  A
    <em>phrase</em> can be turned into a word by, for example, replacing
    spaces with underscores and punctuation characters with hyphens.  A word
    is not allowed to start <em>or end</em> with a period.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p> Not allowing words to end with period prevents ambiguities at the end of
    sentences and avoids trouble with operating systems that append a
    gratuitous period to filenames.  Not allowing words to <em>begin</em> with
    a period follows the Unix convention of hiding filenames that start with a
    period -- some web servers will refuse to serve them, and most will leave
    them out of directory listings.
</p>

<p> Note, too, that <em>case is significant</em> in word directory names (WOAD
    is designed to run on Unix), but lookup is normally case-folded and will
    find all words that differ only in case.  In some contexts (e.g. English
    text), words may be automatically case-smashed in case at the beginnings of
    sentences, but this is not always the correct thing to do: I am grateful
    to Isaac Asimov for pointing out the fact that the pronunciation of POLISH
    is ambiguous, depending on whether you're talking about shoe
    <em>polish</em> or <em>Polish</em> shoes.  Hence it is correct to
    lowercase all the words in ``Polish my shoes, please,'' but not in
    ``Polish shoes please me.''
</p>
</blockquote>

<p> The <code>.word</code> subtree is comparatively ``flat,'' initially having
    only two directory levels underneath it.  (More levels can be added,
    forming a hierarchy of topics like Yahoo or DMOZ.)
</p>

<p> The first level contains directories corresponding to ``contexts;'' the
    second level contains directories corresponding to words and phrases
    <em>in</em> those contexts.  ``Miscellaneous'' words having no specific
    context have directories at the same level as the context directories: in
    this way every word potentially names a context, and every context's name
    is necessarily a word.  This saves us the trouble of figuring out ahead of
    time whether an identifier is a context name or not.
</p>

<p> The first and second levels can also contain <em>index files</em> that map
    words into URL's.  All Woad-maintained annotations for words are contained
    in directories -- the index files are only used to refer to documents
    (including both documents on other servers, and source documents in the
    application).  
</p>

<blockquote> It would be possible to allow files with names like
  <code><em>word</em>.ww</code>, but this would lead to a conflict: is
  <code>foo/definition.ww</code> the definition of the <em>word</em> ``foo'',
  or is it the word ``definition'' in the <em>context</em> ``foo''?  If words
  are always directories we can guarantee the first interpretation.
</blockquote>

<p> The complete set of Woad annotations for <em>word</em> can thus be found
    by looking for ``<code>.word/<em>word</em>/</code>'' and
    ``<code>.word/*/<em>word</em>/</code>''.  The remaining (non-Woad)
    information could theoretically be found by looking for elements with the
    attribute <code>name="<em>word</em>"</code> in the index files
    ``<code>.word/*/*.wi</code>''.
</p>

<p> This, however, would be unbearably tedious, so instead we use one of the
    following alternatives (exactly <em>which</em> alternative is used is up
    to the Woad server administrator -- in other words, <em>you</em>): 
</p>

<ul>
  <li> A database
  </li>
  <li> A CGI script
  </li>
  <li> A separate web server (typically implemented <em>on top of</em> a
       database, although it could be as simple as a PERL program with a
       couple of huge associative arrays). 
  </li>
  <li> The <em>inverted indices</em> located at
       ``<code>.word/.inv/<em>word</em>.wi</code>''.  This is by far the
       simplest to implement.  The <code>.inv</code> subdirectory keeps the
       inverted indices out of the top level so that they don't show up on
       listings.  
  </li>
</ul>

<p> In the short term, the combination of file buffering and the caching of
    directories in the PIA's <code>site</code> package make inverted index
    files quite efficient; in the long term the technique will probably break
    down somewhere in the low thousands of words.
</p>

<p> At some point (possibly quite soon, since it's simple) we will probably
    extend the scheme to allow a hierarchy of context directories.
</p>

<p> It's not entirely clear how to handle cross-references, i.e. finding all
    the places where a given identifier is <em>used</em>.  Conceptually, at
    least, this is just an index, but maintaining it could be a problem.
    Probably it should have &lt;xref&gt; entries instead of &lt;Word&gt;
    entries. 
</p>


<h3><a name="section-1.4">1.4:</a> The <code>.Woad</code> subtree</h3>

<p> The <code>.Woad</code> subtree of the Woad tree is mapped in from its
    ``home'' location in the PIA install tree, <code>pia:/Apps/Woad</code>.
    The top level contains the following sorts of files:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <code>.ts&nbsp;&nbsp;</code> <b>Tagsets</b> -- These files are part of
       the <a href="http://RiSource.org/PIA/">PIA</a>'s executable web-page
       framework: they specify the <em>actions</em> (expansions) associated
       with tags in active pages.
  </li>
  <li> <code>.xh&nbsp;&nbsp;</code> <b>Active Web Pages</b> -- These are the
       pages that provide the help and ``home'' pages for Woad.  These pages
       are in ``XHTML'' and contain Woad- and PIA-specific tags; they can only
       be viewed correctly inside a running Woad server.
  </li>
  <li> <code>.html</code> <b>HTML Documents</b> -- for example, this file.
       The main difference between the HTML pages and the <em>active</em>
       pages is that the HTML pages are <em>pure</em> HTML, and can be read
       ``stand-alone'' by pointing a web browser directly at the corresponding
       file.  This makes them useable <em>before</em> installing Woad or in
       situations where Woad is, for one reason or another, not working and
       you need to figure out why.
  </li>
  <li> <code>.xcf&nbsp;</code> <b>XML Configuration Files</b> -- 
  </li>
  <li> <code>.inc</code>, <code>.xci</code> <b>XML Include Files</b> -- These
       are meant to be included (automatically inserted using the
       &lt;include&gt; tag) in other XML files, and do not stand alone.  They
       are useful when a block of code needs to be used on several different
       web pages.  For example, <code>app-info.inc</code> implements the table
       of current command-line parameters and Woad-tree subtrees.  Another
       common use for include files is to isolate a block of code or text
       that's more likely to be customized than its enclosing document.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> It also contains the following subdirectories:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <code>Tools</code> -- This subdirectory contains the <em>active</em>
       web pages that <em>do things</em>, including the form for creating new
       notes and the active pages that list directories in
  </li>
  <li> <code>Words</code> -- This subdirectory is re-mapped as the virtual
       root of the <em>.word</em> subtree.  This allows word index files, for
       example, to be preconstructed and shipped as part of the Woad
       distribution. 
  </li>
</ul>

<p> Note that, as usual, putting a file of your own somewhere under
    <code><em>real-root</em>/.Woad</code> will override the original in
    <code>PIA/Apps/Woad</code> -- this means that you can easily customize
    your copy of the forms, tagsets, and so on that <ss>Woad</ss> is using.
</p>


<hr />
<h2> <a name="section-2">2:</a> WOAD Web Pages and their Tagsets</h2>

<p> Outside of the <code>.Woad</code> subtree, WOAD only has five kinds of
    files that it treats specially: index files (<code>.wi</code>), annotation
    ``web'' pages (<code>.ww</code>), preprocessed source listings
    (<code>.wl</code>), active documents (<code>.wh</code>), and directories.
</p>

<p> In the <code>.source</code> subtree, all other files are ``listed'' by
    processing them with an appropriate tagset.  Elsewhere, they are simply
    ignored.

<h2> <a name="section-3">3:</a> Index Files and Databases</h2>

<p> An index file, with an extension of ``<code>.wi</code>'', is a simple list
    of XML elements.  An index file has no enclosing element, no XML
    declaration, and no document type, making it a well-formed <em>external
    parsed entity</em> rather than a well-formed XML document.  This
    convention greatly simplifies on-the-fly construction of index files,
    since they can be appended to without having to worry about removing and
    replacing the final end tag.
</p>

<p> The present implementation of WOAD makes extensive use of the file system,
    including directories and XML index files, where another application might
    be expected to use a database.  The PIA, the framework on which WOAD is
    built, makes this kind of thing easy and efficient, and using files makes
    it possible to use ordinary Unix tools (including shell and PERL scripts)
    to construct indices.
</p>

<h3>External Indexers</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p> <em>What's emerging in my investigation of <a
      href="http://lxr.linux.no/"> LXR</a> and other indexing tools is a
      realization that we need better ways of integrating WOAD with other
      tools. </em>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p> One observation about indexers like <a href="http://lxr.linux.no/">
    LXR</a> is that each one essentially defines a <em>context</em> within
    which certain classes of names are recognized.  For example, LXR
    recognizes identifiers in C and C++ code, but ignores comments.  Full-text
    indexers like <a
    href="http://ls6.cs.uni-dortmund.de/ir/projects/freeWAIS-sf/">
    FreeWAIS-sf</a> avoid <em>that</em> problem, but are unable to identify
    declarations.  So both have their place.
</p>

<p> Indexing programs generally also come with a compatible search engine
    (typically a CGI, though in the case of the WAIS family there might also
    be a server version), and often a cross-reference listing program (for
    example LXR's) that makes recognized identifiers into links.
</p>

<p> Integrating indexing programs into WOAD is complicated by the fact that
    they all use different database files, including application-specific
    binary files (WAIS), <code>dbx</code> and other database formats, and
    files tied to Perl hashes (LXR).
</p>

<hr />
<h2> <a name="section-4">4:</a> Word Contexts and Indices</h2>

<h3><a name="section-4.1">4.1:</a> Specifics</h3>

<p> This section lists the default contexts and gives some information about
    how the indexing information is obtained:
</p>

<dl>
  <dt> files
  </dt>
  <dd> all filenames and directory names need to be indexed, both with and
       without extensions.
  </dd>
  <dt> javadoc
  </dt>
  <dd> A comprehensive list of methods can be found in the top-level file
       <code>index-all.html</code>.  Unfortunately it isn't always present; in
       particular, it's missing in Sun's online Java documentation.  The list
       can be reliably computed only by recursively expanding the
       documentation and selecting name anchors that contain types in
       parentheses. 
  </dd>
  <dt> HTML and its derivatives
  </dt>
  <dd> The simplest way to index general HTML is to index only phrases
       enclosed in name anchors.  In addition, ``active'' pages may contain
       declarations; these also have to be indexed.
  </dd>
  <dt> Programming languages
  </dt>
  <dd> In object-oriented languages all package, class and function (method)
       declarations need to be indexed.  Instance variables and global
       variables may need to be indexed in languages that have them (e.g. C
       and C++).
  </dd>
  <dt> English text
  </dt>
  <dd> Normal text does not contain definitions.  Places where words are
       <em>used</em> are treated in the next section.  Files that <em>do</em>
       contain definitions (e.g. glossaries and manuals) may need special
       treatment, although in most cases they will actually be in HTML and
       have the necessary name anchors already in place in one form or
       another.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3><a name="section-4.2">4.2:</a> Occurrences</h3>

<p> Occurrences, i.e., places where a word is <em>used</em> (as opposed to
    <em>defined</em>), are best turned into links (to the word's page)
    ``on-the-fly'' while a page is being viewed.  Locating and listing
    <em>all</em> of the places where an identifier occurs is an expensive
    process.
</p>

<p> However, it's not impossible -- it ``merely'' requires a complete pass
    through all the files in the system.  However, carrying this off requires
    either (1) having a good way to determine which words are going to need
    indexing, or (2) indexing everything (full text indexing).
</p>

<p> So the simplest method is almost certainly going to be full-text
    indexing, which allows us to use a totally separate index for it.  This
    implies that only words with indexed definitions will get links; others
    (e.g. ``<em>this</em>'' will have to be looked up via the form.  There's a
    big advantage to this: it shows the user which words are actually worth
    looking up (in the sense that they have local definitions).
</p>

<p> There are two ways to anchor occurrences:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Link to line numbers.  This works well if we can ensure that the parser
       will insert &lt;line&gt; elements.  It's essentially the <em>only</em>
       option if we're going to use a separate full-text indexer.
  </li>
  <li> Link to occurences.  This requires that we keep track of the occurrences
       of each identifier in the file, so that we can link to, e.g.,
       <pre>&lt;a name="foo.50" href="/.word/foo"&gt;foo&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
  </li>
</ul>

<p> Just as we will often want to use external tools for indexing, so we will
    often want to integrate external viewing and formatting tools.  Examples
    include Javadoc and <code>tsdoc</code>, which generate documentation from
    source code, and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/bonsai.html"> Bonsai
    </a>, which adds CVS annotation to source files.
</p>

<p> There are three cases that need to be considered:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> The tool does its work offline, and generates HTML files, ideally
       somewhere parallel to the source tree.  This is comparatively easy to
       handle -- as long as WOAD can locate the marked-up files given the
       corresponding source path, it can offer them as an alternative.  It has
       the additional advantage that WOAD can easily add its own markup, for
       example linking identifiers to their WOAD referent.  This is not always
       desirable, though, as it may conflict with the tool's own
       cross-reference links.
  </li>
  <li> The tool operates as a CGI script.  This is somewhat more difficult,
       and presents two possibilities: either WOAD simply <em>links</em> to
       the CGI, or it does an <code>&lt;include&gt;</code> (which has higher
       overhead, but allows WOAD to add its own annotation and identifier
       links). 
  </li>
  <li> The tool operates as a separate server.  This presents a situation
       almost identical to that of the CGI script.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> The main thing that needs to happen in order to integrate an external
    viewer is defining the mapping between the <code>.source</code> tree and
    the URL's provided by the viewer.  There are several plausible methods:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Add an index file to every source or source annotation directory,
       e.g. <code>map.wi</code>, which can be included by the listing page.
  </li>
  <li> Put the mapping information into the <code>woad.xcf</code>
       configuration files.
  </li>
  <li> Put a configuration file at the <em>root</em> of the source or source
       annotation tree, and include <em>that</em>.  
  </li>
  <li> Have an auxiliary tagset (or several) which is (are) <em>included</em>
       in <code>src-listing</code> and so on.  This is by far the most
       versatile technique, so that's what we do.
  </li>
</ul>
