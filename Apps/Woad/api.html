<h3>Abstract:</h3>

<blockquote>
<p> This document describes the structures and interfaces of the <font face="sans-serif">WOAD</font> system at the level required for extending
    and customizing it.  The intended audience is web-page and software
    developers -- its purpose is both to help you integrate WOAD into an
    existing suite of applications, and to help you make existing applications
    and documentation (such as cross-indexers, pretty-printers, and
    web-accessible reference material) useful in the WOAD environment.
</p>
<p> The structures and interfaces described here correspond loosely to the
    data structures and application programming interfaces of a conventional
    but customizable software application (EMACS is perhaps the prime
    example).  <em>However,</em> WOAD is a <em>web</em> application, not a
    word processor or software development kit -- the structures and
    interfaces described here are for the most part such things as directory
    structures, file formats, XML schemata, and naming conventions.

<h2> <a name="section-1">1:</a> The <font face="sans-serif">WOAD</font> Tree</h2>

<h3><a name="section-1.1">1.1:</a> The <code>.notes</code> subtree</h3>

<p> The ``subtree'' that contains Woad's page (URL) annotations has by far the
    simplest structure:  every URL on the server corresponds to a
    <em>directory</em> in the <code>.notes</code> subtree that contains the
    annotations for that URL.  Note that this is true even if the URL
    corresponds to an ordinary file with an extension:  the annotation for
    <code>/.../foo.html</code> will be contained in a <em>directory</em>
    called <code>/.notes/.../foo.html/</code>.
</p>

<p> There's only one additional ``catch'' -- most Woad servers don't use the
    prefix <code>/.notes</code> and instead make the root of the annotation
    tree the root of the Woad web server.  This makes for a particularly
    trivial mapping between target URL's and Woad annotation URL's: just
    change the server name.  If the Woad and target servers are on the same
    machine, it's even easier: just change the port number.
</p>

<p> There are two exceptions to this.  The first is for applications where
    the Woad annotations are <em>on the same server as the target.</em> (This
    is true of the PIA, for example.)  The second is for Woad trees that don't
    correspond to a web application at all -- for example, you might be using
    Woad as a directory-tree browser with annotations.
</p>

<h3><a name="section-1.2">1.2:</a> The <code>.source</code> subtree</h3>

<p> Things are slightly more complex in the <code>.source</code> subtree,
    because it effectively ``overlays'' the actual source directory tree -- a
    URL of <code>.source/.../foo.html</code> is supposed to retrieve the
    source listing of <code>foo.html</code>, and this is done by actually
    <em>retrieving</em> <code>foo.html</code> and marking it up on the fly.
</p>

<p> Underneath it all there are two parallel directory trees: one under the
    Woad server's document root (typically <code>~/.woad</code> for a personal
    Woad server running on Unix), making the source annotation directory
    <code>~/.woad/.source</code>, and one under the <em>source</em> root,
    passed to the Woad server on the command line with the
    <code>sources=<em>path</em></code> option.  Whenever a URL starting with
    <code>/.source</code> is requested, the Woad server looks in <em>both</em>
    places: first under its own root, then under the source root.
</p>

<p> Hence, annotations for <code>foo.html</code> have to be contained in a
    special <code>.notes</code> subdirectory of the annotation directory that
    corresponds to <code>foo.html</code>'s <em>parent directory</em>.  This
    could also have been done for directories (putting the annotations for
    the source directory <code>.../bar/</code> under the annotation directory
    <code>.../bar/.notes/</code>), but it wasn't.
</p>

<p> One advantage of this seemingly clumsy arrangement is that the necessary
    index files, and even Woad annotations, can be prepackaged and shipped
    with the source files of a Woad-aware web application.  The biggest
    advantage, though, is that it lets the Woad server format HTML and XML
    source files by simply redefining the tags, in effect applying a (rather
    drastic) stylesheet-like transformation to them.
</p>

<p> It gets better:  Woad handles <em>other</em> languages, for example Perl
    and C, by parsing them into the same internal representation used by the
    XML and HTML parsers and then applying essentially the same set of style
    transformations.
</p>

<p> Finally, some Woad administrators may choose to eliminate the distinction
    between source tree and source <em>annotation</em> tree, and keep the
    annotations directly in the sources all the time.  This is <em>not
    recommended</em> when there are multiple developers and each developer has
    their own complete working copy of the source code (under a version
    control system like CVS) -- in this case it's better to share the
    annotations but keep the code separate.  It <em>does</em> work when
    everyone is working in the same source tree, and a version control system
    like RCS is used to lock the files being edited. 
</p>

<p> Eventually we hope to support multiple developers by allowing both private
    (individual) and public (shared) notes, but implementing this will require
    significant extensions to the PIA's site-structure package.
</p>


<h3><a name="section-1.3">1.3:</a> The <code>.word</code> subtree</h3>

<!--               === this represents a significant change: not yet implemented ===               -->

<p> The <code>.word</code> subtree is comparatively ``flat,'' having only two
    directory levels underneath it.
</p>

<p> The first level contains directories corresponding to ``contexts;'' the
    second level contains directories corresponding to words and phrases
    <em>in</em> those contexts.  ``Miscellaneous'' words having no specific
    context have directories at the same level as the context directories: in
    this way every word potentially names a context, and every context's name
    is necessarily a word.  The first and second levels can also contain
    <em>index files</em> that map words into URL's.  All Woad-maintained
    annotations for words are contained in directories -- the index files are
    only used to refer to documents outside the Woad tree.
</p>

<p> The complete set of Woad annotations for <em>word</em> can thus be found
    by looking for ``<code>.word/<em>word</em>/</code>'' and
    ``<code>.word/*/<em>word</em>/</code>''.  The remaining (non-Woad)
    information could theoretically be found by looking for elements with the
    attribute <code>name="<em>word</em>"</code> in the index files
    ``<code>.word/*/*.wi</code>''.
</p>

<p> This, however, would be unbearably tedious, so instead we use one of the
    following alternatives (exactly <em>which</em> alternative is used is up
    to the Woad server administrator -- in other words, <em>you</em>): 
</p>

<ul>
  <li> A database
  </li>
  <li> A CGI script
  </li>
  <li> A separate web server (typically implemented <em>on top of</em> a
       database). 
  </li>
  <li> The <em>inverted</em> index
       ``<code>.word/.inv/<em>word</em>.wi</code>''.  This last is by far the
       simplest to implement.  The <code>.inv</code> subdirectory keeps the
       inverted indices out of the top level, so that they don't show up on
       listings.  
  </li>
</ul>


<h3><a name="section-1.4">1.4:</a> The <code>.Woad</code> subtree</h3>

<p> The <code>.Woad</code> subtree of the Woad tree is mapped in from its
    ``home'' location in the PIA install tree:  <code>PIA/Apps/Woad</code>.
    The top level contains the following sorts of files:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <code>.ts&nbsp;&nbsp;</code> <b>Tagsets</b> -- These files are part of
       the <a href="http://RiSource.org/PIA/">PIA</a>'s executable web-page
       framework: they specify the <em>actions</em> (expansions) associated
       with tags in active pages.
  </li>
  <li> <code>.xh&nbsp;&nbsp;</code> <b>Active Web Pages</b> -- These are the
       pages that provide the help and ``home'' pages for Woad.  These pages
       are in ``XHTML'' and contain Woad- and PIA-specific tags; they can only
       be viewed correctly inside a running Woad server.
  </li>
  <li> <code>.html</code> <b>HTML Documents</b> -- for example, this file.
       The main difference between the HTML pages and the <em>active</em>
       pages is that the HTML pages are <em>pure</em> HTML, and can be read
       ``stand-alone'' by pointing a web browser directly at the corresponding
       file.  This makes them useable <em>before</em> installing Woad or in
       situations where Woad is, for one reason or another, not working and
       you need to figure out why.
  </li>
  <li> <code>.xcf&nbsp;</code> <b>XML Configuration Files</b> -- 
  </li>
  <li> <code>.inc</code>, <code>.xci</code> <b>XML Include Files</b> -- These
       are meant to be included (automatically inserted using the
       &lt;include&gt; tag) in other XML files, and do not stand alone.  They
       are useful when a block of code needs to be used on several different
       web pages.  For example, <code>app-info.inc</code> implements the table
       of current command-line parameters and Woad-tree subtrees.  Another
       common use for include files is to isolate a block of code or text
       that's more likely to be customized than its enclosing document.
  </li>
</ul>

<p> It also contains the following subdirectories:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <code>Tools</code> -- This subdirectory contains the <em>active</em>
       web pages that <em>do things</em>, including the form for creating new
       notes and the active pages that list directories in
  </li>
  <li> <code>Words</code> -- This subdirectory is re-mapped as the virtual
       root of the <em>.word</em> subtree.  This allows word index files, for
       example, to be preconstructed and shipped as part of the Woad
       distribution. 
  </li>
</ul>

<p> Note that, as usual, putting a file of your own somewhere under
    <code><em>real-root</em>/.Woad</code> will override the original in
    <code>PIA/Apps/Woad</code> -- this means that you can easily customize
    your copy of the forms, tagsets, and so on that <ss>Woad</ss> is using.
</p>

<h2> <a name="section-2">2:</a> WOAD Web Pages and their Tagsets</h2>


<hr />
<h2> <a name="section-3">3:</a> Index Files and Databases</h2>

<p> An index file, with an extension of ``<code>.wi</code>'', is a simple list
    of XML elements.  <em>There is no enclosing element, no XML declaration,
    and no document type</em> -- hence an index file is a <em>parsed
    entity</em> and not a well-formed XML document!  This convention greatly
    simplifies on-the-fly construction of index files, since they can simply
    be appended to without having to worry about removing and replacing the
    final end tag.
