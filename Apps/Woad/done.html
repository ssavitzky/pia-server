  <li> 2000-06-09 <b>Bug</b> can't set targetServer in a subdirectory.<br />
       Need to match and remove a prefix, let's say maybe
       <code>SITE:docOffset</code>. The parameter to set this would then
       be <code>offset=<em>path</em></code>. 
       (2000-06-07)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-07 <b>Hole</b> Do a _subsite.xcf file for standalone Woad <br />
       i.e. an Apache's document root.  This may be simpler than the PIA
       version, but will still involve bug fixes to make the top-level
       <code>/Woad</code> directory work for tagsets and so on.  Of course,
       could put <code>src-*.ts</code> in <code>PIA/lib</code> for now.
       (2000-05-30)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-07 <b>Hole</b> (dps) wrappers, #element, #type in tagsets <br />
       Need to define wrapper element and default bindings for #element,
       #comment, etc.  Default element is handled differently from other node
       types, which have to be rewrapped as elements by the parser.
       GenericHandler has to operate differently for non-elements.
       (2000-05-30)<br />
       -- (element="", documentWrapper, element="#type" 2000-06-05)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-12 <b>Hole</b> (site) WOAD directory listings. <br />
       In order to make WOAD-based directory listings we need to map
       <code>-</code> into something, e.g. <code>IndexDocument</code>.  A web
       page would be cleaner, but it might be simpler to cons up a DOM tree
       and remap the tagset.  The default mechanism <em>does</em> work, FWIW,
       but does not handle "pia:".
       (2000-06-09) <br />
       -- The IndexDocumentPath hack works, too, mapping the listing into a
	  Resource, but unfortunately the Resource is processed in the wrong
	  context (i.e. the one it comes out of).  The Listing has to hold
	  onto the Resource and reprocess it in the right context.  
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-14 <b>Hole</b> (pia, site) error handler for missing documents
       <p> One way to do this is by passing the remaining pathinfo as a query
       to the listing document in the last valid directory in the path.  Note
       that this needs work in both <code>pia</code> and <code>site</code>.
       </p> (2000-06-13)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-16 <b>Bug</b> rename the path parameters per about.html <br />
       (2000-06-14)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-16 <b>Bug</b> target mapping screwed up after changeover <br />
       Neither sources nor notes are properly getting a server link in normal
       mode; everything but the top-level dir. is ok in source-server mode.
       Notes don't map at all.
       (2000-06-16)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-22 <b>Bug</b> fix decorate-path <br />
       Should start with a base URL and go down, rather than using
       <code>..</code>: that way it will work even if there's a tail.
       (2000-06-21)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-23 <b>Hole</b> quick start must explain various setups <br />
       In particular, how to set WOAD up for <em>either</em> personal or
       shared annotations, sources.  Need to make sure the <code>woad</code>
       command has the right defaults.  Must be able to tell it where the real
       (annotation) root is [should be the filename].
       (2000-06-22)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-26 <b>Hole</b> site indexing; links TO pages <br />
       There are two ways to do it: incrementally while browsing the URL tree,
       and offline using a crawler (similar to woad-index.pl).  It's going to
       be slow unless we use a namespace.  (Maybe SITE:siteMap.)  Note that
       after site indexing you can have a "directory" listing at each
       directory-like URL.
       (2000-06-21)
  </li>
  <li>2000-06-28 <b>Hole</b> note listing, editing and creation <br />
       "label" = filename base.  When creating a new note, suffix a number to
       the chosen label.  Combine source and URL listings if possible.
