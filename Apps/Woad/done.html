  <li> 2000-06-09 <b>Bug</b> can't set targetServer in a subdirectory.<br />
       Need to match and remove a prefix, let's say maybe
       <code>SITE:docOffset</code>. The parameter to set this would then
       be <code>offset=<em>path</em></code>. 
       (2000-06-07)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-07 <b>Hole</b> Do a _subsite.xcf file for standalone Woad <br />
       i.e. an Apache's document root.  This may be simpler than the PIA
       version, but will still involve bug fixes to make the top-level
       <code>/Woad</code> directory work for tagsets and so on.  Of course,
       could put <code>src-*.ts</code> in <code>PIA/lib</code> for now.
       (2000-05-30)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-07 <b>Hole</b> (dps) wrappers, #element, #type in tagsets <br />
       Need to define wrapper element and default bindings for #element,
       #comment, etc.  Default element is handled differently from other node
       types, which have to be rewrapped as elements by the parser.
       GenericHandler has to operate differently for non-elements.
       (2000-05-30)<br />
       -- (element="", documentWrapper, element="#type" 2000-06-05)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-12 <b>Hole</b> (site) WOAD directory listings. <br />
       In order to make WOAD-based directory listings we need to map
       <code>-</code> into something, e.g. <code>IndexDocument</code>.  A web
       page would be cleaner, but it might be simpler to cons up a DOM tree
       and remap the tagset.  The default mechanism <em>does</em> work, FWIW,
       but does not handle "pia:".
       (2000-06-09) <br />
       -- The IndexDocumentPath hack works, too, mapping the listing into a
	  Resource, but unfortunately the Resource is processed in the wrong
	  context (i.e. the one it comes out of).  The Listing has to hold
	  onto the Resource and reprocess it in the right context.  
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-14 <b>Hole</b> (pia, site) error handler for missing documents
       <p> One way to do this is by passing the remaining pathinfo as a query
       to the listing document in the last valid directory in the path.  Note
       that this needs work in both <code>pia</code> and <code>site</code>.
       </p> (2000-06-13)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-16 <b>Bug</b> rename the path parameters per about.html <br />
       (2000-06-14)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-16 <b>Bug</b> target mapping screwed up after changeover <br />
       Neither sources nor notes are properly getting a server link in normal
       mode; everything but the top-level dir. is ok in source-server mode.
       Notes don't map at all.
       (2000-06-16)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-22 <b>Bug</b> fix decorate-path <br />
       Should start with a base URL and go down, rather than using
       <code>..</code>: that way it will work even if there's a tail.
       (2000-06-21)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-23 <b>Hole</b> quick start must explain various setups <br />
       In particular, how to set WOAD up for <em>either</em> personal or
       shared annotations, sources.  Need to make sure the <code>woad</code>
       command has the right defaults.  Must be able to tell it where the real
       (annotation) root is [should be the filename].
       (2000-06-22)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-26 <b>Hole</b> site indexing; links TO pages <br />
       There are two ways to do it: incrementally while browsing the URL tree,
       and offline using a crawler (similar to woad-index.pl).  It's going to
       be slow unless we use a namespace.  (Maybe SITE:siteMap.)  Note that
       after site indexing you can have a "directory" listing at each
       directory-like URL.
       (2000-06-21)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-28 <b>Hole</b> note listing, editing and creation <br />
       "label" = filename base.  When creating a new note, suffix a number to
       the chosen label.  Combine source and URL listings if possible.
       (2000-06-22)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-28 <b>Hole</b> annotation tagset. <br />
       We may actually need several: url-space notes / source notes / indices.
       (2000-06-07)<br />
       -- (2000-6-21) in progress 
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-29 <b>Impr</b> HEADER note with content appearing at top of
       page. 
       (2000-06-28)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-07-21 <b>Impr</b> Refactor source viewing <br />
       <code>.li</code> extension -> <code>src-file.ts</code>, ancestral to
       <code>src-html.ts</code> and <code>src-xhtml.ts</code>.  Maybe rename
       <code>*-listing.xh </code> to <code>dir-*.xh</code>
       (2000-07-20)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-08-10 <b>Note</b> Watch out for empty files in annotation dir's <br />
       If somebody has done <code>touch ~/.pia/.words/foo</code> and you later
       ask for <code>/.words/foo</code> you get a ``document contains no
       data'' error, which is correct but confusing.
       (2000-08-10)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-08-22 <b>Impr</b> sources -> source on command line <br />
       for consistancy.
  </li>

  <li> 2000-09-25 <b>Hole</b> chronological, xref index for notes. <br />
       in other words, the indexer has to be run over the notes directory.
       (2000-09-22)
  </li>

  <li> 2000-09-25 <b>Bug</b> woad-index.pl must entity-encode attrs <br />
       Some titles contain quotes, for example.
       (2000-09-25)
  </li>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> allow arbitrary source=target mapping <br />
       either a .wi file, or a tagset included in woad-xhtml.  Needed
       for stuff like <code>/cgi-bin</code>.  Cannot be done in
       <code>.xcf</code> file because that results in undesirable aliasing.
       Could be done with an included tagset.
       (2000-06-23)<br />
       -- can be done with aliases=./..,/..., and offsets=/...,/..., on
	  command line. 
  </li>
       
  <li> 2000-09-29 <b>Hole</b> cross-references for words. <br />
       See hook: <code>TextParser.lookupXref(...)</code>.  Look it up in a
       namespace (which could, e.g., be tied to a database).    Linking can be
       done in listing parser if there's a suitable namespace in context. 
       (2000-09-22)
  </li>

  <li> 2000-10-02 <b>Bug</b> problems with word xref indices <br />
       We may want a different expansion for Def and Ref in xrefs.  In any
       case, there's no expansion for Ref at all.  Def needs to show, and link
       to, context.  The word link is just plain wrong.
       (2000-09-29)
  </li>
       
  <li> 2000-10-06 <b>Goal</b> useable release by 9/30. <br />

       -- internal release for TouchVerse 10/2.  Public release scheduled for
	  10/6. 
  </li>

  <li> 2000-10-06 <b>Hole</b> linking of identifiers to annotation, docs. <br />
       This requires two things: proper tagging of identifiers in context,
       and figuring out where in the tree to link them.  Generally, each
       identifier gets its own page, Wiki style.  In some cases the
       context requires its own page, i.e. for Java identifiers or XHTML
       tags.
       (2000-06-07)<br />
       -- (2000-06-28: annotation listing done.  Ready for indexing and
	  linking.)  The simple thing was to give each identifier its own
	  cross-reference page with an easily-computable URL derived from the
	  identifier itself (lxr does the same).
  </li>
       
  <li> 2000-10-12 <b>Bug</b> AllNotesByTime needs to be appendable <br />
       so that new notes can be appended as they are created.  This means that
       it needs to be oldest-first instead of newest-first, with a link to the
       bottom.
       (2000-10-11)<br />
       -- links: 2000-10-11; woad-index.pl: ; create/edit: 
  </li>

  <li> 2000-10-12 <b>Bug</b> link from a note to the page it annotates. <br />
       Noticeable especially in .sources, where there's an extraneous
       <code>.notes</code> interpolated into the URL.  Obviously another
       mapping function is needed.  Back button is fine, but doesn't work if
       you got there from AllNotesByTime.  Could do this with
       &lt;annotates&gt; tag.
       (2000-09-25)<br />
  </li>

  <li> 2000-10-13 <b>Bug</b> word list uses too much memory <br />
       The correct solution is to use a simple <em>set</em> (i.e. a Namespace
       subclass that maps words to themselves using a Table) and compute the
       links in &lt;id&gt; or else in the parser (simple for now, but
       basically wrong).
       (2000-10-07)<br />
       -- the actual solution uses the xprefix attribute and a map that takes,
	  e.g., <code>word</code> into <code>-W-/</code>.  The trailing slash
	  tells the parser to append the word, lowercased. 
  </li>

  <li> 2000-10-18 <b>Bug</b> word xrefs still use more memory than necessary <br />
       The correct solution is to use a simple Table specified by a new
       namespace-like tag.  TextParser wants a little cleverness to extract
       the table if it exists.
       (2000-10-13)<br />
  </li>
       
  <li> 2000-10-19 <b>Bug</b> TextParser needs to inherit from CodeParser <br />
       currently xrefs is only fixed in TextParser.  Actually, they should
       both inherit from ShallowParser.
       (2000-10-19)

  <li> 2000-10-27 <b>Impr</b> shallow parsing <br />
       <a href="ftp://fas.sfu.ca/pub/cs/TR/1998/CMPT1998-17.html">REX: XML
       Shallow Parsing with Regular Expressions</a> provides the regexp needed
       to mark up an XML file as a listing.  OTOH it's within epsilon of what
       we're already doing in AbstractParser.
       (2000-08-11) <br />
       -- Current implementation of TextParser is different from either, but
	  it seems to work pretty well.
  </li>

  <li> 2000-10-30 ~ <b>Impr</b> xref C code using LXR <br />
       Why re-invent the wheel? <a href="http://lxr.linux.no/">LXR</a> looks
       great, and it's in PERL.  GPL.  Doesn't grok Makefile, html or perl,
       though.

       <a href="http://webglimpse.org/">Glimpse</a> is what

       This article</a> has useful info about doing it in PERL.  Turns out
       that Swish and Glimpse are what Harvest calls "brokers" and BOTH are

       distro is still non-free.

  <li> 2000-11-29 <b>Impr</b> use less space for indexing <br />
       Indexing, especially PIA, eats up an enormous amount of space both for
       RAM and the resulting files.  Going to &lt;Ref ...&gt;line number
       list&lt;/Ref&gt; and a corresponding data structure in the indexer
       fixes this almost completely.
