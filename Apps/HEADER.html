<p> This directory contains stand-alone PIA-based applications.  Unlike the
    applications in <a href="../Agents/">../Agents/</a>, which are meant to be
    used in a personal PIA proxy server, these applications are meant
    to be used by themselves on a dedicated server, or ``mounted'' as a
    top-level subdirectory of a larger site such as an office intranet.
</p>

<p> Furthermore, unlike the sample applications in <a
    href="../Samples/">../Samples/</a>, these are <em>complete</em>
    applications, ready to use ``out of the box'' after proper installation.
    When used without installation as part of a personal or demonstration PIA
    server (such as you are browsing now) they may not be fully functional.

       Web-Organized Application Development )</dt>
  <dd> A web-based ``Integrated Development Environment'' optimized for (but
       not limited to) web applications.  As the name suggests, WOAD allows
       you to use the web to organize a development project, including its
       developer and user communities.  Among other things, it provides a
       web-based way of viewing and annotating source code.
