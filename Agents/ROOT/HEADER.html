<p> This directory contains documents and directories that are meant to be
    made available at the top level (root) of a running PIA application.  They
    are located here because they are used by the agents and applications in
    this directory (which can refer to them reliably using relative paths),
    but they might need to be located in a different place in a deployed
    application.
