# Consider at least the following more specific exclusions:
Disallow: /~		# keeps robots out of your data.
Disallow: /Agency	# Has form for controlling the PIA
Disallow: /DOFS		# Has a form for installing new DOFS's
Disallow: /Demo 	# May contain dangerous forms and active links
Disallow: /Root		# you'd have to be crazy to allow this!
Disallow: /Home		# Likewise: remember the PIA is _you_
Disallow: /History	# Do you really want people to know where you've been?
Disallow: /Cache
Disallow: /Proxie	# Active links
