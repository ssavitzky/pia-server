<h1><a href="../../../-">PIA</a> / <a href="../../-">Agent</a>
    / <a href="../-">ROOT</a> / Icon</h1>

<a href="../-">[..]</a>
<a href="#files">[files]</a>
</p>

<p> This directory contains icons and other images that are shared widely
    throughout the PIA.  Icons that are application-specific should go into
    that application's home directory.  Icons and images used in documentation
    (i.e. in <a href="../../../Doc/">/Doc</a>) should be local to the <a
    href="../../../Doc/">/Doc</a> subtree, since it is occasionally separated
    from the rest of the PIA.  It is expected that the top-level site
    configuration file will make this directory available at the root level as
    <code>/Icon/</code>.

  <dt> <b>Note:</b>
  <dd> When checking in binary files such as PNG's, you need to use:
       <pre>
       cvs add -kb <i>foo.png</i>
       </pre>
  <dt> <b>Logos</b>
  <dd> A name like ``<code>logo24.png</code>'' indicates a plain logo;
       ``<code>pia24.png</code>'' indicates a logo attached to the letters
       ``PIA''.  The number in all cases is the height in pixels.
  <dt> <b>GIF's</b>
  <dd> GIF images have been removed from the PIA and replaced with PNG images
       to avoid patent licensing problems.  Besides, PNG's are smaller.  GIF's
       can still be found in /Doc/API/javadoc/images -- these came from Sun,
       and we're presuming that they're ok.  It's worth noting, though, that
       they are no longer used by recent versions of Javadoc.
