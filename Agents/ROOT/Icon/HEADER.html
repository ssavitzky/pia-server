<h1>Icons for Agents</h1>

<p>
This directory contains icons that are shared by many agents.  Icons that are
agent-specific should go into the Agent's home directory.  Putting icons under
Agency allows them to be overridden by the user.  It also ensures that they
will be available; the Agency agent is always running.

  <dt> <b>Note:</b>
  <dd> When checking in binary files such as PNG's, you need to use:
       <pre>
       cvs add -kb <i>foo.png</i>
       </pre>
  <dt> <b>Logos</b>
  <dd> A name like ``<code>logo24.png</code>'' indicates a plain logo;
       ``<code>pia24.png</code>'' indicates a logo attached to the letters
       ``PIA''.  The number in all cases is the height in pixels.
  <dt> <b>GIF's</b>
  <dd> GIF images have been removed from the PIA and replaced with PNG images,
       to avoid patent licensing problems.  Besides, PNG's are smaller.  GIF's
       can still be found in /Doc/API/javadoc/images -- these came from Sun,
       and we're presuming that they're ok.
