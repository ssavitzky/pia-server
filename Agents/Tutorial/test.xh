    Active XML tags (like
    <code>&lt;if&gt;</code>
    or
    <code>&lt;include&gt;</code>
    ) allow web pages to perform their own processing
    and recursive reference, without the need for separate CGI scripting
    programs or languages.

    , by trying a demo and watching how your modifications appear as
    processed output.
