    </code>

    <p> This demo shows how to use pretty-printing tag to display your source
	as the browser or the PIA processor sees it, with properly indented
	and colorized nesting, and with missing tags inserted. </p>

    <p> The demo encloses some deeply nested text in two
	ways : first in a simple <code>&lt;pretty></code> tag, and second in
	nested <code>&lt;pretty>&lt;protect></code> tags. </p>

    <p> The <code>&lt;pretty></code> tag displays its contents as an indented
	tree of elements, so in the simple first case that contents is the
	"hello" text, in which the entities "dayname" and "year" in the
	<code>&lt;get></code> tags have been replaced by their processed
	results. </p>

    <p> The second part has a <code>&lt;protect></code> tag inside the
	<code>&lt;pretty></code> tag, preventing the <code>&lt;get></code>
	tags from being processed.  Hence the output here shows the "raw"
	source code, as the PIA processor sees it, containing the
	<code>&lt;get></code> tags, but no numbers. </p>

    <p> Note that the <code>&lt;td></code> tag does <b>not</b> have a matched
	closing tag in the source, but that the processor has inserted one (in
	the proper place, fortunately). Also note that the single line of text
	has been broken up, so that each separate chunk (or "node") has its
	own line: three nodes of text, and two of <code>&lt;get></code>
	tags. </p>

    <p> <h3> Stuff to try </h3> </p>

    <p> Try clipping out the lower, <code>protect</code>-ed code from the
	browser window, pasting it into the edit-text box inside the
	<code>&lt;protect></code> tags, and re-processing... it ought to
	reproduce itself. (This is a poor-man's "Structured XML Editor" which
	also understands active tags; it can be very useful for analyzing
	confusingly-nested documents and debugging mismatched tags.). </p>

    <p>Try adding the <code>yellow-tag</code> attribute (i.e. <code>&lt;pretty
	yellow-tag="get"></code>), and watch that tag become highlighted in
	yellow (there is also a <code>white-tag</code> attribute). Or add the
	attribute <code>hide-below-tag="td"</code>, which will prevent display
	of anything below the <code>&lt;td></code> tag.  Or the combined
	attributes <code>hide-below-depth="4"</code> and
        <code>hide-above-depth="2"</code>, which will prevent display of
        anything below or above those respective depths. </p>
