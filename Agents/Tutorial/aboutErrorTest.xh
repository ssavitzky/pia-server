    <p> There is a tag called <code>&lt;show-errors></code> which shows in red
	some (but not all!) of the errors found by the PIA processor up to
	that point in a document.  In this example, we introduce a deliberate
	error by trying to <code>include</code> a file which doesn't exist.</p>

    <p> You can also introduce end-tag errors by deleting the &lt;/set>
	end-tag in the text box, and processing.  (We can't do that for you,
	because the PIA processor automatically creates missing end-tags in
	the process of loading the source code into your editor box.)</p>

    <p> (These errors will also appear as text on a console of the PIA server,
	but in this case that machine resides at Ricoh Silicon Valley and is
	not visible to remote users like you.  Sorry...)</p>

    <p> You may note that the error message appears twice.  The first time is
	from the <code>&lt;show-errors></code> tag you see above; the second
	is from another <code>&lt;show-errors></code> tag we have hidden away
	in the processing wrapper (along with the <code>&lt;html></code> and
	<code>&lt;body></code> tags), to ensure that you can get error
	messages in all the other demos too. </p>
