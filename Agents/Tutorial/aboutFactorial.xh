    </code>

    <p> The first line of this demo uses the <code>&lt;set></code> tag to
	create an "entity" (like a variable) called "numList."  Because the
	tag has empty contents, it has a name but no value (but it could have
	been initialized to have a value of 5, or of "foo", by using
	<code>&lt;set name="numList">5&lt;/set></code> or <code>&lt;set
	name="numList">foo&lt;/set></code>).  At this point, it isn't really a
	list; in fact, even when we later append it, it <i>still</i> isn't a
	list, but a series of strings separated by whitespace (which can be
	later <i>interpreted</i> as a list by the appropriate tags).

    <p> Inside the <code>&lt;repeat></code> tag (as explained in the <a
	href="aboutRepeat.xh">Hello WWW demo</a>), three events happen in
	sequence for each iteration of the <code> repeat.</code>:
    <ol>
       <li> Another item is added to the list.  This occurs inside a
	    <code>&lt;set></code> tag, whose contents are two things: the old
	    list (obtained through <code>&lt;get name="numList"/></code>, and
	    the item to be appended (the iteration number, obtained through
	    <code>&lt;get name="n"/></code>).  So the <code>&lt;set></code> tag
	    sees as its contents a now-longer list, which becomes the new
	    <code>numList</code>.
       <li> The contents of the list (again obtained through
	    <code>&lt;get></code>) are interpreted numerically, inside a
	    <code>&lt;numeric></code> tag.  The non-empty value of the
	    tag's "product" attribute mean that the <code>&lt;numeric></code> tag
	    will calculate and return the product of the numbers found, rather
	    than just returning a list of numbers.  This product is what is
	    printed out at the left of each line.

	<li> The current list itself is printed out as a joined text string,
              (i.e. inside a <code>&lt;text></code> tag), with a separator of
              " x ".  </ol>


	<p><h3>  Stuff to try </h3>
	    
        <p> Try inititalizing the list to a string value ("foo"), and observe
	    that the computed results don't change, because
	    <code>&lt;numeric></code> ignores all non-numeric contents.

	<p> Try changing the start/stop/step values of the
	    <code>&lt;repeat></code> tag, and see what lists result.

	<p> Try changing the "product" attribute to "sum", "difference,"
	    "quotient", or even "sort."  See what happens.
