<h1>.../pia/Agents</h1>

This directory contains a directory for each top-level agent.  This allows
each agent to consist of multiple CGI scripts and documents, and still be
addressable by a single, simple URL.  
<p>

This directory is ``overlaid'' by your personal Agents directory, 
<a href="/~/Agents/">/~/Agents/</a>; this lets you make private versions of any
agent's files.  Your personal Agents directory is located under
<code>$PIA_HOME.</code>
