<h1>PIA Agents and Applications</h1>

<a href="../">[..]</a>
<a href="#files">[files]</a>

<p> This directory contains a subdirectory for each agent or application that
    is meant to be accessible at the top level of a PIA server, i.e. as
    <code>~<em>name</em></code>.  Many of these top-level applications consist
    of an Agent and the pages that control and describe it.

<p> At one time, <em>every</em> top-level directory corresponded to an Agent.
    This is no longer the case, but the old name for this directory has been
    retained for historical reasons.

<p> This directory is ``overlaid'' by your personal Agents directory; this
    lets you make private versions of any agent's files.  Your personal Agents
    directory is normally located under <code>$PIA_HOME</code>; which is
    typically <code>~/.pia</code> on a Unix system.  The last line in the
    directory listing (<a href="#paths">below</a>) will give its actual
    location in this server. 

<p> Some Agents,  the History agent for example, keep data files in a
    subdirectory which is usually called <code>DATA</code>.
    Specialized servers can be configured so that this directory and
    its contents are invisible from the Web.

<h2>Agents</h2>

<p> The following directories contain actual <em>agents</em> -- pieces of XML
    code that are expanded in response to certain conditions in the PIA
    server, along with the active documents that control them: 

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="Admin/">Admin</a>
  <dd> The server-administration agent.  (Strictly speaking this is an
       application, but it actually includes an Agent which is used to ensure
       that administration tags are only executed from inside the Admin
       directory.)  If you are on a Unix machine, you will have to give your
       username and password in order to use this agent. 
  <dt> <a href="Proxie/">Proxie</a>
  <dd> This is also an application, but it serves as a ``front panel'' for a
       collection of agents that are active when the PIA is used as a proxy. 
</dl>

<h2>Applications</h2>

<p> The following directories contain ``web applications'' that may, in some
    cases, be made available as ``home directories'' just like agents.

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="Tutorial/">Tutorial</a>
  <dd> This application provides an introduction to the PIA's tag language.
  <dt> <a href="Demo/">Demo</a>
  <dd> This application consists entirely of pages that demonstrate the PIA's
       tag language.  It is more comprehensive than the <a
       href="Tutorial/">Tutorial</a>, and hence less comprehensible to the
       average new user; it is intended for use as a reference.
  <dt> <a href="SimpleCalendar/">SimpleCalendar</a>
  <dd> This is an application that displays calendar pages and dated events.
       It is made available as <a href="/~Calendar/">/~Calendar</a>.
  <dt> <a href="View/">View</a>
  <dd> This application allows you to view pages using a variety of different
       tagsets.  For example, you can view HTML pages as plain text or as
       ``slide presentations''.
</dl>

<h2>Utilities</h2>

<p> The following directories contain files that are often used by agents and
    applications, but they do not themselves contain agents.

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="defaults/">defaults</a>
  <dd> This directory contains default versions of files like
       <code>home.xh</code> and <code>help.xh</code>.  It is meant to be the
       last item in an agent directory's virtual search path.
  <dt> <a href="ROOT/-">ROOT</a>
  <dd> This directory contains files and subdirectories that are meant to be
       made accessible at the root of a server's URL tree, using an entry like
       <pre> &lt;Container name="Icon" virtual="Agents/ROOT/Icon" /&gt;</pre>
       in the server's configuration file.  They are not included at the top
       level (<code><a href="../../">PIA</a></code>) because they are
       optional and are easier to omit if they're virtual.
