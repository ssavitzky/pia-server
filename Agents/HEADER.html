<h1>.../pia/Agents</h1>

This directory contains a directory for each agent or agent type; each agent
or type is contained in a subdirectory.  This allows each agent to consist of
multiple CGI scripts, documents, and InterForms, and still be addressable by a
single, simple URL.  
<p>

This directory is ``overlaid'' by your personal Agents directory, 
<a href="/~/Agents/">/~/Agents/</a>; this lets you make private versions of any
agent's files.  Your personal Agents directory is located under
<code>$PIA_HOME.</code>
