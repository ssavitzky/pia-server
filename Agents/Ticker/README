The Ticker agent is a true "agent"-- it automatically performs a task every
day at the assigned time.  The timing instructions and the code to be
peformed are both in the _subsite.xcf file: every day it hits a particular
webssite, extracts the pertinent information from its page, and appends that
information to a file (or files).

But Ticker also has ordinary pages like home.xh, which are essentially
unrelated to the "agent" parts.  For example, home.xh hits the same website
and extracts similar information, but displays it on a page without reading
or saving any local files (although it could, if one wanted).
