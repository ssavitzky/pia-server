<h2> I am a sample file-handler</h2> 

<set name="dirname">&user.name;</set>

<set name="filename">&dayname;</set>

This page writes a directory called &dirname; [now] <br />

<output dst="&dirname;" directory="yes" /> <hr />

and writes into it a file called &filename; [now]. <br/>

<output dst="&dirname;/&filename;" > This file was written on &dayname;
&monthname; &day; &year;.  Enjoy! </output>

<hr />

Then it reads that file [now]. <br />

<include src="&dirname;/&filename;" />

<hr />

Finally, just for kicks, it tries reading a non-existent file, to show two
ways the include tag can  deal with such situations. <br />

<include src="dirname/no-such-file" />  
<show-errors />
 
User-supplied error message: <br/>
<include src="dirname/no-such-file" ><i>Oops, file not there.</i></include>
