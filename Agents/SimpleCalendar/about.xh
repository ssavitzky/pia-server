<h1>About the SimpleCalendar Application</h1>

<h2>General Introduction</h2>

<p> The SimpleCalendar is intended mainly as a starting point for further
    development; it is still pretty far from a complete application.  It is,
    however, at the point where it's actually useable for simple cases. 
</p>

<p> This application illustrates some of the issues in flexible web page
    design using the PIA.  The month and day pages, for example, use the
    <code>&lt;navbar&gt;</code> element for their navigation bar; the year
    page uses only the <code>&lt;monthRow&gt;</code> element which is one part
    of it.  Similarly, the <code>grid.xh</code> variant uses
    <code>&lt;show-today&gt;</code> to show today's date, while
    <code>month.xh</code> and <code>year.xh</code> use a customized version of
    the PIA's <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> tag.
</p>

<p> A calendar is perhaps the definitive example of an application whose
    interface everyone has an opinion about, and which one can spend endless
    hours customizing.  Please enjoy.
</p>

<h2>Steve's Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li> The ``old way'' of doing things involved a single page,
       <code>grid.xh</code>, that displayed almost everything.  I have added
       <code>month.xh</code> and <code>year.xh</code> pages that are more
       specialized.
  </li>
  <li> In order to allow switching look and feel where appropriate, I've added
       the ``<code>mpage="month"</code>'' attribute to all formatting elements
       that generate links; and a corresponding form keyword to the
       <code>year.xh</code> page.  This allows the old <code>grid.xh</code> to
       refer to the new <code>year.xh</code> page and eventually get back.
  </li>
  <li> The original <code>navbar</code> element is still around, but it is
       also possible to use the month and year table rows separately, for
       more flexibility in formatting. 
  </li>
  <li> At some point the <code>grid.xh</code> page will probably disappear,
       but the <code>mpage</code> machinery would still be useful if somebody
       wanted an alternative month format. 
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Bill's Wish List</h2>

<ul>
  <li> Filter to show only events at a particular location, time, weekday etc
       </li>

  <li> Fit a whole year's display onto one page, e.g. by making each day only
       one or two characters wide, making months nestle against each other
       (no break in a week spanning months), making months side-by-side, etc.
       And remove any lookup of events from that page, so it is purely
       navigation rather than event display.<br>

       </li>

  <li> Cache the files in memory for quicker calculation.
       </li>
       
  <li> Put a title on each page.<br>
       -- done by Steve, 1999-10-11.
       </li>

  <li> Remove "all" from navbar, and make links from year point to the
       stripped-down year display mentioned above.<br>
       -- done by Steve, 1999-10-11.
       </li>

   <li> Add a year-navbar to the year display page, showing many years on
	either side of the present one (with appropriate links).<br>
