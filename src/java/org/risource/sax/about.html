<h1>About the PIA's SAX Utilities</h1>

<h2>This is <em>NOT</em> the SAX interface!</h2>

<p> The actual interfaces that constitute the SAX API are located in 
    <code><a href="../../xml/sax">org.xml.sax</a></code>.

<p> The DPS uses a set of interfaces that that are quite different from those
    of SAX, and are based on a different model of document processing.  While
    SAX is primarily <em>event-driven</em>, a DPS ``document processor''
    operates by using a <em>cursor</em> that allows the processor to
    <em>traverse</em> a document.  This puts the <em>processor</em> in
    control of the traversal process, rather than the SAX parser or driver.

<p> Nevertheless, the DPS <em>does</em> contain an interface, <a
    href="../dps/Output.java"><code>Output</code></a>, that closely resembles
    the SAX <code>DocumentHandler</code>.  An adapter class is present in this
    directory.  Similarly, an adapter can make an <code>Output</code> or
    <code>Processor</code> implement a SAX <code>DocumentHandler</code> so
    that it can be driven by a SAX parser.
