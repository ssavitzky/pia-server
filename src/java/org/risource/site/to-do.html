  <li> <b>Bug</b> Subsite not loading stripped tagsets <br>
       There is also no indication of where a tagset is actually loaded from.
       (1999-10-14) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Use attributes for property handling <br>
       Using attribute defaults (which we don't have), let properties have
       attributes ``map="prop"'', ``list="prop"'', and ``inherit="yes"''.
       (1999-10-13) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Do not keep config nodelist around <br>
       Process the nodes on the fly instead of collecting them; probably want
       a ToResource output to handle them with.
       (1999-10-08) <br>

  <li> <b>Check</b> locateChildFile for virtual links <br>
       (1999-09-28) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> MSIE thinks it knows what "." means! <br>
       Stupid...  Maybe hyphen? Underscore?  Equal sign?
       Test for FORM: namespace for parameters (may involve processing with a
       special tagset), or make it a virtual container.  List entities?
       (1999-09-23) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> default= not relative to document. <br>
       ... so ".." ends up with /home or worse.
       (1999-09-23) <br>

  <li> <b>Check</b> may need special handling for include in xcf files.<br>
       ... in order to avoid initializing child resources before their
       parents.  May actually need a dummy Subsite for this.
       (1999-09-22) <br>
       -- so far it seems to be working, though.  An alternative might be to
	  invalidate caches where necessary.
       
  <li> <b>Hole</b> Need convention for accessing real, virtual, etc. <br>
       Suggest pseudo-subdirs -r, -v, -d, etc.  -pia, -usr for PIA_HOME,
       HOME.  (Could also use r:, v:, d:, pia:, usr:.)
       (1999-09-22) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Subsites don't get reconfigured when changed. <br>
       <code>subsiteCache</code> is always used.  If a config file is changed
       or a directory added to the virtual path, an existing Subsite won't
       notice.  Minor problem, and <em>very</em> hard to fix without the
       ability to safely re-read config files.
       (1999-09-17) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> DOCUMENT must be parsed with correct tagset. <br>
       (1999-09-16) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Need "realizable" flag. <br>
       Hard to tell which things are pure virtual, and which can be realized. 
       (1999-09-16) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Virtual search paths need work <br>
       May need "file:", "real:", and "virtual:" for absolute, real
       root, and virtual root; / means go to top.
       (1999-09-15) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Should have ImaginaryDoc <br>
       parent of Listing; initialize with either config. or string.  Having a
       parsedContent field in ConfiguredResource is silly.
       (1999-09-15) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Need specialized Namespace for properties <br>
       Needs to know where to save itself, and needs to be synchronized for
       sharing across threads.
       (1999-09-13) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> FileRoot needed <br>
       We need something with a default configuration (for MIME types) and the
       ability to handle paths under a document root, in order to make it 
       possible for TopProcessor to use resources everywhere. 
       (1999-09-13) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Listing should show virtual path <br>
       and indicate which path element each document is in.  The latter will
       probably require a <code>getFlags</code> method on Resource.
       (1999-09-09) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Want a way of getting at an overridden doc. <br>
       Could maybe do this with a virtual container, e.g. -v/foo.
       (1999-09-09) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> All resources need config and name fields.<br>
       This is most clearly seen in Listing.
       (1999-09-08) <br>

  <li> <b>Note</b> W3C's RDF for config? <br>
       <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">Resource Description Framework</a>
       appears to be an XML DTD for describing resources.  The spec is <a
       href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/">here</a>. It uses tagnames
       as property names, inside an &lt;rdf:Description about="URI"&gt; 
       element.  Namespaces are used to specify groups of properties (schemas).
       Properties can also be attributes if their values are strings.
       Containers use <code>ref:Bag</code>, <code>rdf:Seq</code>, and
       <code>rdf:Alt</code> elements, but <code>Description</code> elements
       don't nest inside them; they <em>do</em> nest in
       <code>Description</code> elements, which are virtual bags.
       (1999-09-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> use pure DOM nodes for config<br>
       There may be cases in which it's convenient to use a different
       representation for the configuration.
       (1999-09-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Defaults in extension map <br>
       <ul> 
	 <li> <code>"/"</code> for containers
	 <li> <code>""</code> for documents with <em>no</em> extension
	 <li> <code>"*"</code> for documents with an <em>unknown</em> extension.
       </ul>
       (1999-09-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Agent initialization <br>
       Need a way to initialize agents.  For now just keep the current
       scheme, with the Root (Admin?) agent loading a file. 
       (1999-09-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Links <br>
       We need full support for links (i.e. references to
       <code>FileResource</code>'s that are <em>not</em> realizable. 
       (1999-09-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Note</b> SiteMachine should allow header changes. <br>
       Either by delaying headers until first non-blank content, or by
       recognizing an extension/tagset as capable of generating headers.
       (1999-09-03) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Subsite.locateChild needs work <br>
       Needs to have extension in inner loop, search path in outer.  Currently
       it's the other way around.
       (1999-09-03) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Use &lt;container&gt; and &lt;document&gt; in cfg. <br>
       Not clear whether to keep &lt;Resource&gt; or not; probably a good idea
       to keep it for, e.g., files where we haven't determined whether it's a
       directory or not.
       (1999-08-23) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Need a way to turn off caching in Subsite <br>
       Do the basic lookup in ConfiguredResource, and use it if no location
       cache exists.  Check a flag to see whether to build the cache.
       (1999-08-23) <br>

  <li> <b>Note</b> alien resources. <br>
       An ``alien'' resource is a link (alias) to something outside the site,
       with no real counterpart.  An alien resource cannot be realized.  Best
       represented by a <code>FileResource</code>.
       (1999-08-23) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Generate metadata from extension <br>
       The tagset stuff should eventually be considered a special case of
       mapping metadata from a file's extension.
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> An Agent is a Document. <br>
       The metadata associated with an agent (e.g. AGENT.XML) really needs to
       be <em>just</em> a Document.  Whenever the agent's state changes it
       just writes itself out.
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> generate README on realize <br>
       Note that when a container is realized, one typically wants to
       construct a README file pointing to its virtual source.  This might
       actually be done using an agent!  (Which implies that they're
       <em>not</em> just for the PIA, so a <code>pia</code> Agent might be an
       extension of a <code>site</code> Agent.)  Sounds like we may want
       agents that ``listen'' for events on a Resource.
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> tagset for directories. <br>
       Generating the index for a container that doesn't have a
       <code>home.xh</code> document ought to be done by applying a tagset to
       the container's configuration element.  We can use a pseudo-extension
       of ``<code>/</code>'' for this. 
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> utility to retrieve a processed document <br>
       This would correspond to ``<code>cat</code>'' the way <code>List</code>
       corresponds to ``<code>ls</code>''.  More generally, this should be
       able to realize and otherwise operate on documents as well.
