  <li> <b>Bug</b> need special handling for include in xcf files.<br>
       ... in order to avoid initializing child resources before their
       parents.  May actually need a dummy Subsite for this.
       (1999-09-22) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Need convention for accessing real, virtual, etc. <br>
       Suggest pseudo-subdirs -r, -v, -d, etc.
       (1999-09-22) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Subsites don't get reconfigured when changed. <br>
       <code>subsiteCache</code> is always used.  If a config file is changed
       or a directory added to the virtual path, an existing Subsite won't
       notice.  Minor problem, and <em>very</em> hard to fix without the
       ability to safely re-read config files.
       (1999-09-17) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> DOCUMENT must be parsed with correct tagset. <br>
       (1999-09-16) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Need "realizable" flag. <br>
       Hard to tell which things are pure virtual, and which can be realized. 
       (1999-09-16) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Virtual search paths need work <br>
       May need "file:", "real:", and "virtual:" for absolute, real
       root, and virtual root; / means go to top.
       (1999-09-15) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Should have ImaginaryDoc <br>
       parent of Listing; initialize with either config. or string.  Having a
       parsedContent field in ConfiguredResource is silly.
       (1999-09-15) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Need specialized Namespace for properties <br>
       Needs to know where to save itself, and needs to be synchronized for
       sharing across threads.
       (1999-09-13) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> FileRoot needed <br>
       We need something with a default configuration (for MIME types) and the
       ability to handle paths under a document root, in order to make it 
       possible for TopProcessor to use resources everywhere. 
       (1999-09-13) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Listing should show virtual path <br>
       and indicate which path element each document is in.  The latter will
       probably require a <code>getFlags</code> method on Resource.
       (1999-09-09) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Want a way of getting at an overridden doc. <br>
       (1999-09-09) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Unknown config sub-elts should become props. <br>
       Any unknown element in the configuration should be appended to a
       property entity with that name.  Maybe the known ones, too.
       (1999-09-09) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> pure-virtual document gives null pointer exc. <br>
       ... which is not surprising, since there's no way to specify its
       content at the moment.
       (1999-09-09) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Subsite doesn't inherit files properly <br>
       Need to set real, virtual, and default files properly.  Currently
       <code>file</code> gets the virtual location if the real one doesn't
       exist. 
       (1999-09-09) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> All resources need config and name fields.<br>
       This is most clearly seen in Listing.
       (1999-09-08) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Want a way to get generic listing.<br>
       The simplest way would be a virtual child called ``<code>.</code>'';
       this can be constructed using the default ``<code>.xh</code>'',
       defaulting to a Listing if it's not present.
       (1999-09-08) <br>

  <li> <b>Note</b> W3C's RDF for config? <br>
       <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/">Resource Description Framework</a>
       appears to be an XML DTD for describing resources.  The spec is <a
       href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-rdf-syntax/">here</a>. It uses tagnames
       as property names, inside an &lt;rdf:Description about="URI"&gt; 
       element.  Namespaces are used to specify groups of properties (schemas).
       Properties can also be attributes if their values are strings.
       Containers use <code>ref:Bag</code>, <code>rdf:Seq</code>, and
       <code>rdf:Alt</code> elements, but <code>Description</code> elements
       don't nest inside them; they <em>do</em> nest in
       <code>Description</code> elements, which are virtual bags.
       (1999-09-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> use pure DOM nodes for config<br>
       There may be cases in which it's convenient to use a different
       representation for the configuration.
       (1999-09-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Defaults in extension map <br>
       <ul> 
	 <li> <code>"/"</code> for containers
	 <li> <code>""</code> for documents with <em>no</em> extension
	 <li> <code>"*"</code> for documents with an <em>unknown</em> extension.
       </ul>
       (1999-09-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Agent initialization <br>
       Need a way to initialize agents.  For now just keep the current
       scheme, with the Root (Admin?) agent loading a file. 
       (1999-09-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Links <br>
       We need full support for links (i.e. references to
       <code>FileResource</code>'s that are <em>not</em> realizable. 
       (1999-09-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Note</b> SiteMachine should allow header changes. <br>
       Either by delaying headers until first non-blank content, or by
       recognizing an extension/tagset as capable of generating headers.
       (1999-09-03) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Subsite.locateChild needs work <br>
       Needs to have extension in inner loop, search path in outer.  Currently
       it's the other way around.
       (1999-09-03) <br>

  <li> <b>Goal</b> Implement and integrate with PIA <br>
       <ol>
	 <li> [1999-09-02] finish implementing, mainly the loading of config
	      files.  
	 <li> [1999-09-03] Add to PIA as access for non-Agent paths.
	 <li> simplify <code>org.risource.pia.Agent</code> and use
	      <code>org.risource.site.Site</code> for all documents. 
       </ol>
       (1999-08-23) goal: 09-03<br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Use &lt;container&gt; and &lt;document&gt; in cfg. <br>
       Not clear whether to keep &lt;Resource&gt; or not; probably a good idea
       to keep it for, e.g., files where we haven't determined whether it's a
       directory or not.
       (1999-08-23) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Need a way to turn off caching in Subsite <br>
       Do the basic lookup in ConfiguredResource, and use it if no location
       cache exists.  Check a flag to see whether to build the cache.
       (1999-08-23) <br>

  <li> <b>Note</b> alien resources. <br>
       An ``alien'' resource is a link (alias) to something outside the site,
       with no real counterpart.  An alien resource cannot be realized.  Best
       represented by a <code>FileResource</code>.
       (1999-08-23) <br>

  <li> <b>Note</b> Document should set up Processor somehow. <br>
       There's no good way now to negotiate between a Processor and a Document
       to set up the <em>optimum</em> kind of Input or to decide whether the
       Document wants to drive the Processor as an Output. 
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Generate metadata from extension <br>
       The tagset stuff should eventually be considered a special case of
       mapping metadata from a file's extension.
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Metadata becomes entity bindings. <br>
       The DOC: namespace for a resource probably ought to be
       <em>precisely</em> its XML metadata, with the configuration added in
       using some application-specific mapping (i.e. it needs to be different
       for WebDAV).
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> An Agent is a Document. <br>
       The metadata associated with an agent (e.g. AGENT.XML) really needs to
       be <em>just</em> a Document.  Whenever the agent's state changes it
       just writes itself out.
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> generate README on realize <br>
       Note that when a container is realized, one typically wants to
       construct a README file pointing to its virtual source.  This might
       actually be done using an agent!  (Which implies that they're
       <em>not</em> just for the PIA, so a <code>pia</code> Agent might be an
       extension of a <code>site</code> Agent.)  Sounds like we may want
       agents that ``listen'' for events on a Resource.
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> tagset for directories. <br>
       Generating the index for a container that doesn't have a
       <code>home.xh</code> document ought to be done by applying a tagset to
       the container's configuration element.  We can use a pseudo-extension
       of ``<code>/</code>'' for this. 
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> utility to retrieve a processed document <br>
       This would correspond to ``<code>cat</code>'' the way <code>List</code>
       corresponds to ``<code>ls</code>''.  More generally, this should be
       able to realize and otherwise operate on documents as well.
