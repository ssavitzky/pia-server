  <li> <b>Note</b> SiteMachine should allow header changes. <br>
       Either by delaying headers until first non-blank content, or by
       recognizing an extension/tagset as capable of generating headers.
       (1999-09-03) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Subsite.locateChild needs work <br>
       Needs to have extension in inner loop, search path in outer.  Currently
       it's the other way around.
       (1999-09-03) <br>

  <li> <b>Goal</b> Implement and integrate with PIA <br>
       <ol>
	 <li> [1999-09-02] finish implementing, mainly the loading of config
	      files.  
	 <li> [1999-09-03] Add to PIA as access for non-Agent paths.
	 <li> simplify <code>org.risource.pia.Agent</code> and use
	      <code>org.risource.site.Site</code> for all documents. 
       </ol>
       (1999-08-23) goal: 09-03<br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Use &lt;container&gt; and &lt;document&gt; in cfg. <br>
       Not clear whether to keep &lt;Resource&gt; or not; probably a good idea
       to keep it for, e.g., files where we haven't determined whether it's a
       directory or not.
       (1999-08-23) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Need a way to turn off caching in Subsite <br>
       Do the basic lookup in ConfiguredResource, and use it if no location
       cache exists.  Check a flag to see whether to build the cache.
       (1999-08-23) <br>

  <li> <b>Note</b> alien resources. <br>
       An ``alien'' resource is a link (alias) to something outside the site,
       with no real counterpart.  An alien resource cannot be realized.  Best
       represented by a <code>FileResource</code>.
       (1999-08-23) <br>

  <li> <b>Note</b> search paths. <br>
       Note that typically the search path will have three components: the
       real location, the virtual location and the defaults.  
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> <b>Note</b> Document should set up Processor somehow. <br>
       There's no good way now to negotiate between a Processor and a Document
       to set up the <em>optimum</em> kind of Input or to decide whether the
       Document wants to drive the Processor as an Output. 
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Generate metadata from extension <br>
       The tagset stuff should eventually be considered a special case of
       mapping metadata from a file's extension.
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Metadata becomes entity bindings. <br>
       The DOC: namespace for a resource probably ought to be
       <em>precisely</em> its XML metadata, with the configuration added in
       using some application-specific mapping (i.e. it needs to be different
       for WebDAV).
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> An Agent is a Document. <br>
       The metadata associated with an agent (e.g. AGENT.XML) really needs to
       be <em>just</em> a Document.  Whenever the agent's state changes it
       just writes itself out.
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> generate README on realize <br>
       Note that when a container is realized, one typically wants to
       construct a README file pointing to its virtual source.  This might
       actually be done using an agent!  (Which implies that they're
       <em>not</em> just for the PIA, so a <code>pia</code> Agent might be an
       extension of a <code>site</code> Agent.)  Sounds like we may want
       agents that ``listen'' for events on a Resource.
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> tagset for directories. <br>
       Generating the index for a container that doesn't have a
       <code>home.xh</code> document ought to be done by applying a tagset to
       the container's configuration element.
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> utility to retrieve a processed document <br>
       This would correspond to ``<code>cat</code>'' the way <code>List</code>
       corresponds to ``<code>ls</code>''.  More generally, this should be
       able to realize and otherwise operate on documents as well.
