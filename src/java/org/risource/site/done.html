  <li> 1999-09-02 <b>Hole</b> load config files.  <br>
       This is half of the biggest pending hole:  getting the files loaded in
       the first place.
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> 1999-09-02 <b>Hole</b> process config elements.  <br>
       This is the other half of the biggest pending hole:  processing the XML
       once it's been loaded.  Need to extract child configurations, extension
       mapping, and the default search path.
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> 1999-09-03 <b>Note</b> search paths. <br>
       Note that typically the search path will have three components: the
       real location, the virtual location and the defaults.  
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> 1999-09-09 <b>Bug</b> Listing needs to use Resource, not File.<br>
       Currently it uses <code>base.listNames()</code> to get names, but
       needs to look at the children as resources, not files.  Similarly, it
       needs to use a Document for <code>HEADER.html</code>, not a File. 
       (1999-09-08) <br>

  <li> 1999-09-15 <b>Bug</b> Virtual search paths relative to what? <br>
       Right now you can't use a relative path in a <code>virtual</code>
       configuration attribute (for example) because there's nothing to base
       it on. 
       (1999-09-09) <br>
       -- for now assume virtual base
       
  <li> 1999-09-16 <b>Bug</b> Need to load config from a Document <br>
       ...otherwise we don't have any context for things like agents.
       Top level needs a processor factory.
       (1999-09-15) <br>

  <li> 1999-09-16 <b>Bug</b> Case insensitivity of HTML: use xxml <br>
       The case insensitivity of tagsets that include HTML means that we have
       to base the config tagset on xxml.
       (1999-09-13) <br>

  <li> 1999-09-22 <b>Bug</b> Not finding local tagsets in non-standard configs! <br>
       It works in the normal case, but not with <br>
       <code>pia -config Config/Site/sample.xcf</code><br>
       Sounds like some defaults aren't getting properly set.
       (1999-09-22) <br>
       -- Pilot error: <code>-config</code> sets the config file name;
	  <code>-site</code> sets the site configuration file path.

  <li> <b>Bug</b> pia-tagset not found if a virtual resource <br>
       The java-resource version is loaded, so it doesn't have a proper
       timestamp and is not reloaded if changed.  The problem is that
       locateChildFile is used instead of locateChild.
       (1999-09-26) <br>
