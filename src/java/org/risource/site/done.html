  <li> 1999-09-02 <b>Hole</b> load config files.  <br>
       This is half of the biggest pending hole:  getting the files loaded in
       the first place.
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> 1999-09-02 <b>Hole</b> process config elements.  <br>
       This is the other half of the biggest pending hole:  processing the XML
       once it's been loaded.  Need to extract child configurations, extension
       mapping, and the default search path.
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> 1999-09-03 <b>Note</b> search paths. <br>
       Note that typically the search path will have three components: the
       real location, the virtual location and the defaults.  
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> 1999-09-09 <b>Bug</b> Listing needs to use Resource, not File.<br>
       Currently it uses <code>base.listNames()</code> to get names, but
       needs to look at the children as resources, not files.  Similarly, it
       needs to use a Document for <code>HEADER.html</code>, not a File. 
       (1999-09-08) <br>

  <li> 1999-09-15 <b>Bug</b> Virtual search paths relative to what? <br>
       Right now you can't use a relative path in a <code>virtual</code>
       configuration attribute (for example) because there's nothing to base
       it on. 
       (1999-09-09) <br>
       -- for now assume virtual base
       
  <li> 1999-09-16 <b>Bug</b> Need to load config from a Document <br>
       ...otherwise we don't have any context for things like agents.
       Top level needs a processor factory.
       (1999-09-15) <br>

  <li> 1999-09-16 <b>Bug</b> Case insensitivity of HTML: use xxml <br>
       The case insensitivity of tagsets that include HTML means that we have
       to base the config tagset on xxml.
       (1999-09-13) <br>

  <li> 1999-09-22 <b>Bug</b> Not finding local tagsets in non-standard configs! <br>
       It works in the normal case, but not with <br>
       <code>pia -config Config/Site/sample.xcf</code><br>
       Sounds like some defaults aren't getting properly set.
       (1999-09-22) <br>
       -- Pilot error: <code>-config</code> sets the config file name;
	  <code>-site</code> sets the site configuration file path.

  <li> 1999-09-28 <b>Bug</b> pia-tagset not found if a virtual resource <br>
       The java-resource version is loaded, so it doesn't have a proper
       timestamp and is not reloaded if changed.  The problem is that
       locateChildFile is used instead of locateChild.
       (1999-09-26) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Unknown config sub-elts should become props. <br>
       Any unknown element in the configuration should be appended to a
       property entity with that name.  Maybe the known ones, too.
       (1999-09-09) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> pure-virtual document gives null pointer exc. <br>
       ... which is not surprising, since there's no way to specify its
       content at the moment.
       (1999-09-09) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Subsite doesn't inherit files properly <br>
       Need to set real, virtual, and default files properly.  Currently
       <code>file</code> gets the virtual location if the real one doesn't
       exist. 
       (1999-09-09) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Want a way to get generic listing.<br>
       The simplest way would be a virtual child called ``<code>.</code>'';
       this can be constructed using the default ``<code>.xh</code>'',
       defaulting to a Listing if it's not present.
       (1999-09-08) <br>

  <li> <b>Goal</b> Implement and integrate with PIA <br>
       <ol>
	 <li> [1999-09-02] finish implementing, mainly the loading of config
	      files.  
	 <li> [1999-09-03] Add to PIA as access for non-Agent paths.
	 <li> simplify <code>org.risource.pia.Agent</code> and use
	      <code>org.risource.site.Site</code> for all documents. 
       </ol>
       (1999-08-23) goal: 09-03<br>

  <li> <b>Note</b> Document should set up Processor somehow. <br>
       There's no good way now to negotiate between a Processor and a Document
       to set up the <em>optimum</em> kind of Input or to decide whether the
       Document wants to drive the Processor as an Output. 
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Metadata becomes entity bindings. <br>
       The DOC: namespace for a resource probably ought to be
       <em>precisely</em> its XML metadata, with the configuration added in
       using some application-specific mapping (i.e. it needs to be different
       for WebDAV).
       (1999-08-20) <br>

  <li> 1999-10-12 <b>Bug</b> Namespace properties don't work <br>
       (1999-10-08) <br>

  <li> 1999-10-12 <b>Bug</b> Failure opening unreadable directory. <br>
       null pointer exception  at locateChildren(Subsite.java:482)
       (1999-10-12) <br>
       -- turns out <code>File.list()</code> can return null.

  <li> 1999-10-12 <b>Bug</b> Extension map seems to be broken. <br>
       Can't seem to override tagsets or document types, and it seems to
       default to the old <code><em>Agent</em>-xhtml</code> convention.  This
       is recent. 
       (1999-10-12) <br>
       -- pilot error:  the files were in regions controlled by their own
	  _subsite.xcf files!  (urk!)

  <li> 1999-10-12 <b>Bug</b> Doesn't work too well when virtual root != PIA <br>
       Can't load tagsets, and gets a default extension map anyway.
       Root has a real directory even though <code>real="none"</code>.
       (1999-10-12) <br>

  <li> 1999-10-12 <b>Bug</b> Home document name must be settable. <br>
       Right now it's hard-wired, which loses if you need to change it.
       (1999-10-12) <br>

  <li> 1999-10-14 <b>Bug</b> Need access to namespaces of ancestor containers <br>
       (1999-10-08) <br>

  <li> 1999-10-18 <b>Bug</b> MSIE thinks it knows what "." means! <br>
       Stupid...  Maybe hyphen? Underscore?  Equal sign?
       Test for FORM: namespace for parameters (may involve processing with a
       special tagset), or make it a virtual container.  List entities?
       (1999-09-23) <br>

  <li> 1999-10-18 <b>Hole</b> An Agent is a Document. <br>
       The metadata associated with an agent (e.g. AGENT.XML) really needs to
       be <em>just</em> a Document.  Whenever the agent's state changes it
       just writes itself out.
       (1999-08-20) <br>
       -- now done differently: an agent doesn't have any significant state;
	  it's all in its subsite.

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Recursion on bogus tagset <br>
       Specifying a tagset (pia-xhtml with no path) in &lt;include&gt;
       bombs in an infinite recursion.  Genuinely missing tagset is OK.

       -- Pilot error: there was a tagset "pia-xhtml" in <code>.pia</code>
	  that specified itself as parent.  Duh!

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Use &lt;container&gt; and &lt;document&gt; in cfg. <br>
       Not clear whether to keep &lt;Resource&gt; or not; probably a good idea
       to keep it for, e.g., files where we haven't determined whether it's a
       directory or not.
       (1999-08-23) <br>

  <li> 1999-12-14 <b>Bug</b> Virtual search paths need work <br>
       May need "file:", "real:", and "vroot:" for absolute, real
       root, and virtual root; / means go to top.
       (1999-09-15) <br>
       -- (1999-12-08) they work in include and tagset loader, at least.
	  Really need to revise the stuff in TopContext to use site package
	  all the time, with appropriate Resource nodes getting returned.

  <li> 2000-04-19 <b>Bug</b> aliases don't work under servletrunner <br />
       At least at the top level, so things like the icons are broken.  Works
       fine under JServ, apparently  because vroot is defined.
       (2000-04-19)<br />
       -- subsite: locateVirtual needed to use real path when virtual path not
	  defined. 
  </li>
  <li> 2000-05-29 <b>Bug</b> pia:, file:, root:, vroot: broken <br />
       in <code>locate</code> and <code>getRelative</code>
       (2000-06-01)<br />
       -- Oddly enough, they are still broken sometimes -- locate doesn't seem
	  to work consistently with FileDocument.
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-14 <b>Hole</b> error handler for missing documents <br />
       One way to do this is by passing the remaining pathinfo as a query to
       the listing document in the last valid directory in the path.  Note
       that this needs work in <code>pia</code> both <code>site</code>.
       (2000-06-13)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-06-19 <b>Bug</b> (site) real directory masks virtual one! <br />
       If the virtual path of a container is <code>pia:/...</code>, a real
       directory <em>hides</em> it.  This happens during configuration; adding
       or removing the real directory has no effect afterwards.  One symptom
       is that the virtual path shows up as <code>pia:/...</code> instead of
       the actual path, as it does normally.  But it <em>does</em> show up!
       (2000-06-19)<br />
       -- Subsite.configAttrs was doing <code>new File</code> instead of
	  <code>locateVirtual</code>. 
  <li> 2000-06-27 <b>Bug</b> (woad) suspect isn't propagated. <br />
       home document and tagsets getting loaded from config file.  Possibly
       <code>base</code> isn't getting set early enough.
