<p> This package, <code>org.risource.dom</code>, contains classes and
    interfaces that constitute a simplified API for programmers who wish to
    use the DPS as part of an application that also uses the World Wide Web
    Consortium's <a href="../../w3c/dom">DOM</a> (Document Object Model).
</p>

  <dd> Interfaces that combine the DOM and ``Active'' interfaces.  Classes that
       implement these interfaces can be efficiently traversed using cursors,
       and processed using the DPS.

  <dd> Classes that <em>implement</em> the DOM Core and Active interfaces, for
       use in building parse trees.

<h2>Note</h2>
<blockquote><em>
  Originally this package simply contained a complete implementation of an
  early draft of the DOM, and <a href="../dps/active">dps.active</a>
  extended it.  Now that the ``official'' interfaces are in <a
  href="../../w3c/dom"><code>org.w3c.dom</code></a> we have taken the
  opportunity to correct the situation.
</em></blockquote>

<p> At the moment, <code><a href="../dps/tree/">../dps/tree/</a></code>
    contains an implementation of the interfaces of DOM level 1, as extended
    in <code><a href="../dps/active/">../dps/active/</a></code>.  Much of the
    behavior, however, is considerably different from what the DOM
    specification requires, and at some point it can reasonably be expected
    that the PIA may abandon all pretense of being DOM-compatible in its
    internal representation.
</p>

<p> This says nothing about the PIA's <em>external</em> interfaces.  We remain
    absolutely committed to keeping the PIA as compatible as possible with
    published standards (although due to our limited resources, there will
    inevitably be a time lag -- for example, we are just now getting around to
    writing ToDocument after a year or so of neglect).
