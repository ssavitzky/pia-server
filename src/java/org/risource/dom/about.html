<h1>About the PIA's DOM Utilities</h1>

<h2>This is <em>NOT</em> a DOM implementation!</h2>

<p> An implementation of the W3C's DOM interfaces can be found in
    <code><a href="../dps/tree">org.risource.dps.tree</a></code>, with
    extended interfaces for ``active nodes'' in
    <code><a href="../dps/tree">org.risource.dps.active</a></code>.

<p> The DPS uses a set of interfaces that are almost completely orthogonal to
    those of the DOM.  While the DOM's interfaces model a document as a
    (doubly-linked) tree of Node objects, the DPS interfaces define a family of
    <em>cursors</em> that allow the processor to <em>traverse</em> a tree.
    The advantage of the cursorial approach over the arboreal is that the tree
    being traversed need not all be in memory at once.

<p> In spite of the cursorial interface's advantages, it <em>is</em> sometimes
    necessary to construct an actual parse tree.  The DOM, though perhaps not
    the best interface for this kind of thing, works well enough.  The <a
    href="tree/">tree</a> subdirectory contains a complete implementation of
    the DOM which also implements the ``Active'' interface required for the
    DPS, and the navigational methods required for an efficient implementation
    of cursors.

<p> This package, <code>org.risource.dom</code>, is meant to contain utility
    classes that use the ``pure'' DOM interfaces from
    <code><a href="../../w3c/dom">org.w3c.dom</a></code>.


<h2>Evolution</h2>

<p> This directory originally contained a complete collection of interfaces
    and implementation classes for an earlier version of the DOM.  

<p> Now that the ``official'' interfaces are in <a
    href="../../w3c/dom"><code>org.w3c.dom</code></a> we have taken the
    opportunity to correct the situation.
