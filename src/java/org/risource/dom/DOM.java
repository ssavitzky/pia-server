/**
 * The "DOM" interface provides a number of methods for performing operations that are
 * independent of any particular instance of the document object model. The only
 * operations currently supported is to retrieve the factory object. It is expected,
 * however, that other operations such as querying for the version number of a
 * particular DOM implementation, or asking about the versions of HTML or XML
 * supported by a particular DOM implementation would also be present on this
 * interface. Although IDL does not provide a mechanism for expressing the concept,
 * the methods supplied by the DOM interface will be implemented as "static", or
 * instance independent, methods. This means that a client application using the DOM
 * does not have to locate a specific instance of the DOM object; rather, the methods
 * are will be available directly on the DOM class itself and so are directly
 * accessible from any execution context.
