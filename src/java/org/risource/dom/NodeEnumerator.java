 /**This class provides a generic iteration mechanism over an arbitrary collection of
  * nodes. The nodes may be enumerated in either forward or reverse order, and the
  * direction of enumeration may be changed at any time. The enumerator behaves as
  * though it had an internal "pointer" to the current node, and provides methods for
  * abstractly changing the notion of what the current node is.
  * 
  * Typical usage (in some C++ like language) might look like:
  * 
  *     NodeEnumerator nodeEnum = document.getChildren().getEnumerator();
  * 
  *     for (Node node = nodeEnum.first(); node != null; node = nodeEnum.next()) {
  * 
  *         // ... do some computation on that node
  *     }
