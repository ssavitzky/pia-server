 * The Text object contains the non-markup portion of a document. For XML documents,

 * wstring data 
 *      This holds the actual content of the text node. Text nodes contain just plain
 *      text, without markup and without entities, both of which are manifest as
 *      separate objects in the DOM. 
 * boolean isIgnorableWhitespace 
 *      This is true if the Text node contains only whitespace, and if the whitespace
 *      is ignorable by the application. Only XML processors will make use of this, as
 *      HTML abides by SGML's rules for whitespace handling.
