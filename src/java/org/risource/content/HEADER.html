This directory contains generic implementations of the <a
href=../pia/Content.java> Content </a> interface.
A content objects is used to represent the "content" of a <A
href=../pia/Transaction.java>transaction</a>, usually streaming data (HTML page, JPEG
file, etc.) being sent from a Web server to a browser.  The content interface
provides a very generic way for <a href=../pia/Agent.java>agents</a> to get
access to or modify
the data in transit.  Some agents (e.g. cache agent) grab a copy of the data and
put it into a file (using the <code>tapIn or tapOut</code> methods), while others modify the data  (e.g. Proxie inserts a
toolbar just after the body tag of HTML pages using the <code>add</code> method). <p>

The content classes in this directory are normally instantiated by a <a
href=../pia/ContentFactory.java> ContentFactory</a>.  The default
ContentFactory uses mime type to find a name of the corresponding content
class, so <a href=text/html.java> text/html.class</a> would be the class
instantiated for data of type text/html.  If no specific type is found a
default is used <a href=ByteStreamContent.java>ByteStreamContent</a>.

<p>
All of these classes inherit from <a
href=StreamingContent.java>StreamingContent</a> which provides all of the
machinery for a circular buffer.  It also keeps track of state changes and
uses that to notify interested agents when at appropriate times.  
In theory, new content classes can be implemented by subclassing
StreamingContent and providing appropriate <code>readData</code> and
<code>writeData</code> methods.
Note that
these classes are complicated by the fact that we want to start shipping the
data out to a browser as soon as possible (without waiting for the entire data
structure to be in memory), so a content object has to keep track of any
modifications specified by an agent and perform them at the appropriate time
as the data is being shipped through the circular buffer.
