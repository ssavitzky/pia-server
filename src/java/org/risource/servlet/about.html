<h1>About the PIA's Servlet implementations</h1>

<p> The PIA includes two implementations of the Servlet interface: PIAServlet
    and DPSServlet.
</p>

<ol>
  <li> <a href="PIAServlet.java">PIAServlet</a> is as faithful an
       implementation of the PIA server as is feasible within a Servlet engine
       environment:  it reads a PIA configuration file, sets up the Site
       structure, and essentially takes over.  It should be mapped onto the
       root of the server's URL (virtual path) tree.   About the only thing it
       <em>doesn't</em> do is run agents on proxied requests. 
  </li>
  <li> <a href="DPSServlet.java">DPSServlet</a> assumes that its context
       can map a URL onto a file, and simply runs that file through the DPS.
       The only complication is the need to construct the table that maps
       filenames into tagsets. 
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p> So far, PIAServlet has only been tested in Apache-JServ and Sun's
    <code>servletrunner</code> in JSDK2.0.  Because <code>PIAServlet</code> is
    still <em>highly</em> experimental, it should be configured with a path to
    a file that it uses as a log file.  Configuration files for JServ can be
    found in <a href="../../../../../Config/Servlet/">PIA/Config/Servlet</a>.
    If you run the PIA under <code>servletrunner</code> you <em>must</em> tell
    it where to find the tagsets (the <code>home</code> initialization
    parameter), otherwise it will fail with a null pointer exception whenever
    it tries to load a tagset.
</p>

<p> The biggest problem with PIAServlet so far is that a Servlet is
    effectively a subdirectory, and JServ has no way to ``mount'' a Servlet
    on the server's root.  There are two main ways of dealing with this:
</p>

<ol>
  <li> Use <code>mod_rewrite</code> or the equivalent to map
       pathnames onto the PIA servlet.  This pretty-well renders your server
       useless for serving ordinary files, so you may as well just use the PIA
       server. 
  </li>
  <li> Use the <code>PIA:url</code> and <code>PIA:rootPath</code> entities in
       your <code>.xh</code> files to refer to the Servlet root.  The entities
       are defined correctly both in the standalone PIA and in the PIAServlet.
       This allows a PIA-based application to co-exist with other applications
       in your server.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p> Assuming you have JSDK2.0 and <code>servletrunner</code>, you can start
    the server with the command:
</p>
<pre>
 /usr/local/JSDK2.0/bin/servletrunner -r ~/PIA
</pre>

<p> and point your browser to:
</p>
<pre>
 <a href="http://localhost:8080/servlet/org.risource.servlet.PIAServlet/"
 >http://localhost:8080/servlet/org.risource.servlet.PIAServlet/</a>
</pre>

<h2>To-Do list</h2>

<ul>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> URL space for include, etc. still rooted at / <br />
       ... instead of PIA:rootPath, which might be more consistent.  Right now
       paths used for tagsets and include files that start with "/" are
       relative to the servlet rather than the server.

  </li>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> Logging uses a PrintStream. <br />
       really need to have a logger class that can pass the buck to the
       servlet.  There should be a static pointer to it, i.e. Log.logger, so
       that classes like tagset.Loader and TopProcessor can find it.

  </li>
</ul>

<h3>done</h3>
<ul>
  <li> 2000-04-12 <b>Bug</b> DPSServlet has no tagset mapping.<br />
       Should take <code>tagset.<em>ext</em>=<em>tsname</em></code> and
       <code>type.<em>ext</em>=<em>mime-type</em></code> initialization
       parameters. 
       (2000-04-05)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-04-13 <b>Bug</b> No PIA namespace in PIAServlet<br />
       (2000-04-05)
  </li>
  <li> 2000-04-14 <b>Bug</b> Site cannot be a subdirectory.<br />
       currently need to use <code>mod_rewrite</code> to map <code>/xxx</code>
       to <code>/PIA/xxx</code>. 
       (2000-04-05)
  </li>
  <li>2000-04-18 <b>Bug</b> Doesn't handle queries. <br />
       This one's serious.
       (2000-04-18)
  </li>
       
</ul>
