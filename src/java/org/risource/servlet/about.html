<h1>About the PIA's Servlet implementations</h1>

<p> The PIA includes two implementations of the Servlet interface: PIAServlet
    and DPSServlet.
</p>

<ol>
  <li> <a href="PIAServlet.java">PIAServlet</a> is as faithful an
       implementation of the PIA server as is feasible within a Servlet engine
       environment:  it reads a PIA configuration file, sets up the Site
       structure, and essentially takes over.  It should be mapped onto the
       root of the server's URL (virtual path) tree.   About the only thing it
       <em>doesn't</em> do is run agents on proxied requests. 
  </li>
  <li> <a href="DPSServlet.java">DPSServlet</a> assumes that its context
       can map a URL onto a file, and simply runs that file through the DPS.
       The only complication is the need to construct the table that maps
       filenames into tagsets. 
  </li>
</ol>
