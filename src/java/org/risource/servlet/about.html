<h1>About the PIA's Servlet implementations</h1>

<p> The PIA includes two implementations of the Servlet interface: PIAServlet
    and DPSServlet.
</p>

<ol>
  <li> <a href="PIAServlet.java">PIAServlet</a> is as faithful an
       implementation of the PIA server as is feasible within a Servlet engine
       environment:  it reads a PIA configuration file, sets up the Site
       structure, and essentially takes over.  It should be mapped onto the
       root of the server's URL (virtual path) tree.   About the only thing it
       <em>doesn't</em> do is run agents on proxied requests. 
  </li>
  <li> <a href="DPSServlet.java">DPSServlet</a> assumes that its context
       can map a URL onto a file, and simply runs that file through the DPS.
       The only complication is the need to construct the table that maps
       filenames into tagsets. 
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p> So far, PIAServlet has only been tested in Apache-JServ.  Because
    <code>PIAServlet</code> is still <em>highly</em> experimental, it needs to
    be configured with a path to a file that it uses as a log file, and
    <code>mod_rewrite</code> or the equivalent needs to be used to map
    pathnames onto the PIA servlet (since JServ effectively requires each
    servlet to be a subdirectory). 
</p>

<h2>To-Do list</h2>

<ul>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> No PIA namespace in PIAServlet<br />
       (2000-04-05)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> Site cannot be a subdirectory.<br />
       currently need to use <code>mod_rewrite</code> to map <code>/xxx</code>
       to <code>/PIA/xxx</code>. 
       (2000-04-05)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> Logging uses a PrintStream. <br />
       really need to have a logger class that can pass the buck to the
       servlet.  There should be a static pointer to it, i.e. Log.logger, so
       that classes like tagset.Loader and TopProcessor can find it.
       (2000-04-05)
  </li>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> DPSServlet has no tagset mapping.<br />
       Should take <code>tagset.<em>ext</em>=<em>tsname</em></code> and
       <code>type.<em>ext</em>=<em>mime-type</em></code> initialization
       parameters.
