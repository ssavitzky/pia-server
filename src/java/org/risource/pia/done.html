  <li> 1998-10-?? <b>Bug</b> GenericAgent.findInterform needs extension list.
       <br>
       Actually, finding files ought to be in a utility class, because you
       need to get out: the file pathname, the URL path, and the part of the
       URL after the file that was found (which gets passed to the
       interform). 
       (1998-10-13) <br>
       
  <li> 1998-10-30 <b>Hole:</b> PIA datatype transition. <br>
       During the transition Agent and Transaction need to be able to
       return both SGML and DOM data as needed.  Fortunately most of the
       namespaces contain only strings; it's really only hooks that differ.
       (1998-06-18) <br>
       -- Make Agent and Transaction implement an interface with methods
	  like <code>getObjectAt</code> and <code>getStringAt</code>,
	  etc. instead of the Attr interface; sort it out in the handlers.
       
  <li> 1998-10-30 <b>Bug</b> DPS hooks aren't executed <br>
       (1998-10-28)<br>

  <li> 1999-01-04 <b>Hole</b> <code>handle</code> subdir for tag handlers <br>
       Agent-specific handlers are in Agent. 
       (1998-12-17) <br>

  <li> 1999-02-09 <b>Bug</b> ~ doesn't work in some cases. <br>
       ~Agent/ works, but ~Agent doesn't. In general, a directory only gets
       found if a / is present.  Sounds like a redirection bug.
       (1999-02-05) <br>
       -- fixed by a cleanup of the redirection code, and more use of
	  urlDecode. 

  <li> 1999-02-09 <b>Bug</b> Agent~ doesn't work at all. <br>
       (1999-02-05) <br>
       -- findInterform was removing the agent name while mistaking it for the
	  type. 

  <li> 1999-02-10 <b>Bug</b> /~/dir doesn't work. <br>
       ~/HEADER.html works, but ~/Admin doesn't.  ROOT/~/Admin does. ~/Config
       does. 
       (1999-02-09) <br>
       -- Due to the fact that Admin is an agent and Config isn't.  The
	  problem is in Resolver.agentFromPath().

  <li> 1999-02-?? <b>Hole</b> remove Interform interpretor completely <br>

  <li> 1999-02-19 <b>Bug</b> Directory uses &lt;base&gt;. <br>
       Instead, it should use absolute paths for its links, and <em>fix</em>
       any relative links in HEADER.html.  The problem is that the base breaks
       when the system name is not what <code>hostname</code> returns (e.g.,
       <code>localhost</code>).  There is no choice but redirection or link
       fixup if an <code>index.html</code> exists.
       (1999-02-19) <br>
       -- done except for fixing the redirect problem.

  <li> 1999-02-22 <b>Hole</b> remove legacy tagset <br>
