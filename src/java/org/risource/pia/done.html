  <li> 1998-10-?? <b>Bug</b> GenericAgent.findInterform needs extension list.
       <br>
       Actually, finding files ought to be in a utility class, because you
       need to get out: the file pathname, the URL path, and the part of the
       URL after the file that was found (which gets passed to the
       interform). 
       (1998-10-13) <br>
       
  <li> 1998-10-30 <b>Hole:</b> PIA datatype transition. <br>
       During the transition Agent and Transaction need to be able to
       return both SGML and DOM data as needed.  Fortunately most of the
       namespaces contain only strings; it's really only hooks that differ.
       (1998-06-18) <br>
       -- Make Agent and Transaction implement an interface with methods
	  like <code>getObjectAt</code> and <code>getStringAt</code>,
	  etc. instead of the Attr interface; sort it out in the handlers.
       
  <li> 1998-10-30 <b>Bug</b> DPS hooks aren't executed <br>
       (1998-10-28)<br>

  <li> 1999-01-04 <b>Hole</b> <code>handle</code> subdir for tag handlers <br>
       Agent-specific handlers are in Agent. 
       (1998-12-17) <br>

  <li> 1999-02-09 <b>Bug</b> ~ doesn't work in some cases. <br>
       ~Agent/ works, but ~Agent doesn't. In general, a directory only gets
       found if a / is present.  Sounds like a redirection bug.
       (1999-02-05) <br>
       -- fixed by a cleanup of the redirection code, and more use of
	  urlDecode. 

  <li> 1999-02-09 <b>Bug</b> Agent~ doesn't work at all. <br>
       (1999-02-05) <br>
       -- findInterform was removing the agent name while mistaking it for the
	  type. 

  <li> 1999-02-10 <b>Bug</b> /~/dir doesn't work. <br>
       ~/HEADER.html works, but ~/Admin doesn't.  ROOT/~/Admin does. ~/Config
       does. 
       (1999-02-09) <br>
       -- Due to the fact that Admin is an agent and Config isn't.  The
	  problem is in Resolver.agentFromPath().

  <li> 1999-02-?? <b>Hole</b> remove Interform interpretor completely <br>

  <li> 1999-02-19 <b>Bug</b> Directory uses &lt;base&gt;. <br>
       Instead, it should use absolute paths for its links, and <em>fix</em>
       any relative links in HEADER.html.  The problem is that the base breaks
       when the system name is not what <code>hostname</code> returns (e.g.,
       <code>localhost</code>).  There is no choice but redirection or link
       fixup if an <code>index.html</code> exists.
       (1999-02-19) <br>
       -- done except for fixing the redirect problem.

  <li> 1999-02-22 <b>Hole</b> remove legacy tagset <br>

  <li>1999-03-12 <b>Bug</b> Agent.put("criteria", v) must split <br>
       Need to split <code>v</code> on whitespace.
       (1999-02-22) <br>

  <li> 1999-03-19 <b>Bug</b> need per-agent document and data directories <br>
       This would have two good effects: avoid searching in the obsolete
       <code>src/Agents</code>, and allow agents to be anywhere.  Actually the
       InterForm search path should be a real path; data is just a single
       dir.  Should have the following attributes on Agent:
       <ul>
	 <li> <code>codeDir</code> the code directory.  Default is
	      <code>Agents/<em>path</em></code>.  
	 <li> <code>userDir</code> user's overrides
	 <li> <code>dataDir</code> the data; <em>always</em> using
	      <code>~</code> 
       </ul>
       Note that currently the <code>if_root</code> attribute preceeds the
       default paths, but does not override them.  Similarly, many possible
       roots and paths are currently searched. 
       (1998-12-17) <br>
       -- Note that as of 1999-02-09 this is mostly, if not completely, done
       
  <li> 1999-03-19 <b>Impr</b> InterForm lookup should be in a utility class <br>
       Possibly both FileAccess and the InterForm stuff should be in a "util"
       sub-package. 
       (1998-11-02)<br>

  <li> 1999-03-23 <b>Impr</b> Agent naming with paths. <br>
       See <a href="/Doc/Notes/steve/naming.html">note</a>.
       (1999-03-11) <br>      

  <li> 1999-03-23 <b>Hole</b> Better agent naming conventions. <br>
       specified using the following attributes on Agent:
       <ul>
	 <li> <code>name</code> the base name.
	 <li> <code>base</code> the agent's ``mount point''
	 <li> <code>path</code> the full path relative to the PIA's document
	      root: <code>base/name</code> -- this is the unique key for
	      looking up the agent. 
       </ul>
       (1998-12-22) <br>

  <li> 1999-04-19 <b>Bug</b> Directory uses redirect for index.html. <br>
       Redirection breaks when the system name is not what
       <code>hostname</code> returns (e.g., <code>localhost</code>).  There
       are only two choices here: redirect and hope the full URL is in the
       headers, or returning the file and fixing the links.  
       (1999-02-19) <br>
       -- Redirection is the lesser of two evils here, having tried both.

  <li> 1998? <b>Impr:</b> ISO 8601 date representation (dashes) <br>
       See <a href="http://www.ft.uni-erlangen.de/~mskuhn/iso-time.html">this
       summary</a>.  The main things needing fixing are the entity table
       initialization, and dates as presented by the History agent's hook.
       (1998-06-18) <br>
       -- Should add timezone and UTC time/date as well.

  <li> 1999-04-27 <b>Bug</b> Fix Agent namespace operations <br>
       AGENT:agent messes up the agent namespace: needs to be AGENTS:agent.
       The Tabular ops have to go through the namespace rather than the other
       way around, and initialization from a table needs to do the same.  When
       fixed, go into ActiveDoc and change (Tabular)agent to agent in two
       places.
       (1999-04-22) <br>

  <li> 1999-04-27 <b>Bug</b> no namespace for all installed agents. <br>
       (1998-10-12) <br>
       
  <li> 1999-04-28 <b>Bug</b> AGENTS:foo:bar <br>
       Still not working because Agent doesn't take it to the next level
       anymore.  Should be done in Index instead.
       (1999-04-27) <br>

  <li> 1999-04-30 <b>Hole</b> Ability to save and restore Agents as XML <br>
       Need to distinguish the initialization done at create time from that
       done after read-in.  There should be an attribute that says whether to
       read the init file.  Distinguish installation (file in agent directory)
       from restart (file in user directory).
       (1999-04-07) <br>

  <li> 1999-05-06 <b>Bug</b> Rename install -> create <br>
       Now that there are two ways to install agents (load and create),
       ``install'' is inaccurate in most places.
       (1999-05-05) <br>

  <li> 1999-05-06 <b>Impr</b> Install agent from arbitrary directory. <br>
       When loading an agent from an arbitrary directory, need special hack to
       override the "home-dir" attribute in the XML file.  Possibly the name
       as well.  Things get even more complicated if the XML is accessed from
       a web server.
       (1999-04-30) <br>

  <li> 1999-05-06 <b>Hole</b> Admin must save and restore Agents as XML. <br>
       Admin agent needs to keep track of where they are.  Possibly by having
       the agent submit a form.  Be nice if type agents could optionally
       manage their own subs.
