/**
 * An agent is an object which maintains state and context and corresponds
 *	to a URL in the PIA server. 
 *
 * <p> Agents can receive requests directly (http://pia/AGENT_NAME/...);
 *	they can also operate on other transactions.  Direct requests are
 *	handled by the <code>respond</code> methods.  To operate on other
 *	transactions, Agents register with the resolver a set of criteria for
 *	transactions they are interested in.  When the resolver finds a
 *	matching transaction, the agents act_on method is called (and the
 *	agent can modify the transaction.  The agent can completely handle a
 *	transaction by putting itself on the transaction's list of handlers --
 *	which results in a call back to the agents handle method.
