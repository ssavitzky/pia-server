<h2>To-Do List</h2>
<ol>
  <li> <b>Check</b> SiteDoc may no longer need prefix support. <br>
       should do it via the root.
       (1999-12-14) <br>

  <li> <b>Check</b> make sure CGI works <br>
       Make sure one can specify processor, access all relevant environment
       variables (including PIA_HOME, etc.).
       (1999-11-01) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Transaction should do all logging. <br>
       Because acceptor and transaction do logging in different threads, the
       log is confused.
       (1999-10-21) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> May need a tag to do DNS lookup. <br>
       (1999-10-21) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Need permissions as well as authentication. <br>
       Need to be able to authorize, e.g., selected users for writing, and let
       everyone read.  
       (1999-10-05) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Authorization must use Site for passwds. <br>
       Currently Authenticator uses a raw File to get the passwords; this
       works for the moment but really ought to use the site stuff.
       (1999-10-05) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Register agents in PiaSite <br>
       It's no longer necessary or desirable for Resolver to do this.
       (1999-10-05) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> PUT still missing <br>
       see old GenericAgent and FileAccess.  Probably very easy now.
       (1999-10-04) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> eliminate Pia.piaPropTable. <br>
       Just go through the existing properties to determine which ones to suck
       in from the file. 
       (1999-10-04) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> flag to update site config from command line. <br>
       The command line properties are usually transient, but in some cases it
       may be desirable to create an updated site configuration file which
       includes them.
       (1999-10-04) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Get rid of Logger; rationalize reporting. <br>
       Really need to standardize the multiple versions of report, message,
       etc.; create a small number of log streams (server, error, message).
       (1999-09-28) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> problems with AGENT: namespace<br>
       You can't get at the actual agent and its content.  May need a new
       kind of wrapper, or cleverness in Index to handle a binding that's an
       element rather than a namespace.
       (1999-09-24) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> need to use default=../Toolbar in remoteTools<br>
       and of course fix the corresponding files.
       (1999-09-23) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Simplified command line<br>
       Command line should specify config file (with no option flag) or root
       directory (with <code>_subsite.xcf</code> file), and optional
       assignments, e.g. <code>port=8001</code> that override attributes in
       the outer &lt;Container&gt; element.  No property file.  Everything
       else should come from the config.  Add <code>pia:</code> to specify
       directories in the PIA_HOME hierarchy.  Ignore the Java property list
       except during initialization.
       (1999-09-23) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Use <code>Site</code> to simplify Pia. <br>
       <em>All</em> of the metadata on Pia should be obtained from the
       configuration.  Maybe Pia should simply extend Site.  If not, at least
       it should get its metadata (port, etc.) from the Site.  There does need
       to be a PIA <em>namespace</em>, but it, too, should be site metadata.
       (1999-09-10) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> need global flag that suppresses agent initialization <br>
       Need to separate the &lt;AGENT&gt; tag's action from the actual
       initialization -- at the very least the whole directory has to be
       configured first.  Agent home pages need to check to see if their agent
       is actually running, and offer to activate it if not.  The intended
       usage is to activate everything that's supposed to be active on
       start-up, then manage the rest. 
       (1999-09-22) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> PUT not supported (again) <br>
       There was stuff in FileAccess to support this.
       (1999-09-22) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> &lt;submit-forms&gt; untested. <br>
       (1999-09-22) <br>

       <p>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Makefiles should work from DOS <br>
       That means that there should be recursive targets that don't use the
       shell.
       (1999-06-14) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Servlet Interface <br>
       Both the Resolver and Agent need to respond to the Servlet interface.
       There also needs to be a way to wrap an arbitrary Servlet as an Agent
       or (perhaps better) as a document inside an Agent. 
       (1999-06-11) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Criteria ought to be XML <br>
       Among other things, there should be a way to perform arbitrary tests on
       a header.  It may even be desirable to allow arbitrary XXML code; this
       would also simplify programming, though it would require a different
       TopContext for efficiency.
       (1999-06-11) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> No way for an act-on method to respond. <br>
       There doesn't seem to be any way for an XML act-on method to specify
       that the agent is to <em>handle</em> (respond to) the transaction.
       (1999-05-25) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> use more namespaces instead of tables <br>
       The PIA namespace, MIME types, etc. should all be namespaces and saved
       as XML, rather than property lists saved as <em>name=value</em> pairs.
       (1999-05-24) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Use more buffered streams and writers. <br>
       Content would be simplified (currently StreamContent does its own
       buffering; text content implementations are problematic).  There are
       probably some other places where files, etc. are read or written.
       (1999-05-10) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> ProcessedContent should wait for first text. <br>
       ProcessedContent should wait for the first non-blank text before
       sending anything to the client.  This would allow the .xh file to
       modify the Transaction and headers, e.g. for error messages. 
       (1999-04-30) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> AgentBuilder should re-init. if necessary. <br>
       Needs to check and see if the agent ``under construction'' actually
       exists.  In that case, it needs to <em>re</em>-initialize instead of
       blowing away the whole structure.
       (1999-05-03) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Regexp and Jigsaw must go! <br>
       (1999-02-09) <br>
       -- Jigsaw has been pared down to only what we need; RegExp is still a
	  problem.

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Header parsing exception handling <br>
       In a response, parseInitializationString should set defaults instead of
       throwing an exception, so that the browser at least gets the page.
       Ideally it should insert a suitable error message at the top of the
       page.
       (1998-11-16) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Namespaces needed: PIA, ENV, LOG, AGENTS <br>
       PIA: PiaProperties; basically everything on the Pia class.
       ENV: the environment (Java system props)
       LOG: User messages.  names include "debug", "message", "verbose", ...
       AGENTS: Resolver's agent table.  Initialize an agent with
       <code>&lt;set name=AGENTS:foo&gt;options&lt;/&gt;</code>.
       Need version info in PIA namespace.
       (1998-11-02)<br>
       -- PIA (1999-03), AGENTS (1999-04-27)
       
  <li> <b>Hole</b> Interface Cleanup <br>
       Make most attributes conform to get/set convention instead of the
       legacy perl convention.  Remove most convenience methods,
       e.g. the ones that set criteria, etc.

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> ProcessedContent doesn't do insertions. <br>
       Neither does its predecessor, InterFormContent.
       (1998-07-08) <br>
