<h2>Cleanup and refactoring</h2>
<ol>
  <li> Move Piaproperties to <code>ds</code>; rename.
  <li> Make a generic Tabular wrapper similar to Piaproperties.  Use for
       extracting typed data from generic tables, attr lists, etc.  Could be
       based on Assoc.
  <li> Rename Tabular to StringMap
  <li> Use StringMap interface for headers, etc.
  <li> <b>Hole</b> Simplify the Pia class and initialization.
</ol>

<h2>Main List</h2>
<ol>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> option to autosave agent-files <br>
       Admin agent option to autosave when an agent is loaded or saved.
       (1999-05-18) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Use more buffered streams and writers. <br>
       Content would be simplified (currently StreamContent does its own
       buffering; text content implementations are problematic).  There are
       probably some other places where files, etc. are read or written.
       (1999-05-10) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> ProcessedContent should wait for first text. <br>
       ProcessedContent should wait for the first non-blank text before
       sending anything to the client.  This would allow the .xh file to
       modify the Transaction and headers, e.g. for error messages. 
       (1999-04-30) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> AgentBuilder should re-init. if necessary. <br>
       Needs to check and see if the agent ``under construction'' actually
       exists.  In that case, it needs to <em>re</em>-initialize instead of
       blowing away the whole structure.
       (1999-05-03) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Need per-agent mapping of extension to tagset. <br>
       It really needs to be possible to fully specify the mapping of file
       extension to tagset.  The present technique is kludgy.  In some cases
       the mapping needs to include access method (GET/PUT/POST).
       (1999-03-11) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Regexp and Jigsaw must go! <br>
       (1999-02-09) <br>
       -- Jigsaw has been pared down to only what we need; RegExp is still a
	  problem.

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Header parsing exception handling <br>
       In a response, parseInitializationString should set defaults instead of
       throwing an exception, so that the browser at least gets the page.
       Ideally it should insert a suitable error message at the top of the
       page.
       (1998-11-16) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Namespaces needed: PIA, ENV, LOG, AGENTS <br>
       PIA: PiaProperties; basically everything on the Pia class.
       ENV: the environment (Java system props)
       LOG: User messages.  names include "debug", "message", "verbose", ...
       AGENTS: Resolver's agent table.  Initialize an agent with
       <code>&lt;set name=AGENTS:foo&gt;options&lt;/&gt;</code>.
       Need version info in PIA namespace.
       (1998-11-02)<br>
       -- PIA (1999-03), AGENTS (1999-04-27)
       
  <li> <b>Hole</b> Interface Cleanup <br>
       Make most attributes conform to get/set convention instead of the
       legacy perl convention.  Remove most convenience methods,
       e.g. the ones that set criteria, etc.

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> ProcessedContent doesn't do insertions. <br>
       Neither does its predecessor, InterFormContent.
       (1998-07-08) <br>
