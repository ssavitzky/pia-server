<h2>Recent Changes</h2>

<p> As of 9/9/99 (End Of File Day -- seems appropriate) I am starting to make
    major changes in the implementation of Agents and the PIA core server.  As
    of 9/22 they are checked in on the <em>internal</em> CVS server and open
    for general hacking.  Nevertheless some of the former Agents are very much
    ``under construction.''

<p> The main change is that Agents no longer handle Transactions directly
    under most circumstances (the old <code>handle</code> method will still be
    there so that a specialized agent can handle transactions if it has to.  A
    cache agent might do this, for example.)  Agents <em>do not</em> handle
    transactions directed at their ``home URL'' -- these are handled by a new
    object, the ``Site Machine'' (class <code><a
    href="site/SiteMachine.java">org.risource.pia.site.SiteMachine</a></code>),
    which uses the <a href="../site/about.html">Site Resource Package</a>.

<p> If a Transaction is not proxied, its default action is to go to the PIA's
    ``Site'' (<code>Pia.getSite()</code>), locate the <code>Resource</code>
    specified by the URL, and return the associated document.  This is done by
    means of a one-line change in <code>HTTPRequest.toMachine</code> that
    defaults to to <code>Pia.getSiteMachine()</code> when no toMachine has
    been specified.

<p> As a result of this change, a ``Root'' agent is no longer necessary; its
    function was simply to map URL paths onto agents.  It is also no longer
    necessary to have an Agent for each top-level directory in URL space; the
    net effect is to speed up transaction processing in the Resolver.  Mapping
    URL's to files is also sped up considerably because the classes in the <a
    href="../site/"><code>org.risource.site</code></a> package do the lookup
    more efficiently than <code>GenericAgent</code> used to.

<p> It is possible to register a ``home directory'' in URL space that is
    web-accessible as ``<code>/~<em>name</em></code>'' following the usual
    web/Unix convention for home directories.  (Note that in the Reader's
    Helper, for example, it would make a great deal of sense to give each user
    a home directory.)  These directories will <em>usually</em> be associated
    with agents, though this need not be the case.  The ability to have
    unregistered agents and non-agent home directories gives the site designer
    full control over the top-level namespace.

<p> Even if an Agent has not registered its home directory at the top level it
    will still have one: the directory in which the forms that control the
    agent reside.  An Agent used to be a namespace in its own right; this
    function is now taken over by the ``properties'' of the agent's home
    directory.  In fact, an Agent is now simply an <code>&lt;AGENT&gt;</code>
    element in the configuration of its home Resource.


<h3>Views</h3>

<p> Because the top-level configuration file of a Site does not have to be
    part of the Site, it's easy to construct multiple views of a directory
    (for example, the PIA).  For example, simply making the PIA home directory
    the root should give a purely passive view of the tree.  For a specialized
    appliance server with a limited set of agents, the root might be
    <code>PIA/Agents/ROOT</code>, with the actual agent directories
    virtualized, and the documentation virtualized read-only.


<h2>Design Decisions</h2>

<h3>Agent Alternativess</h3>

<p> There are four plausible implementations for Agents:

<ol>
  <li> Each Agent has a ``state document'' (e.g. <code>AGENT.xml</code>) in
       its home Resource.  Saving an Agent's state is fairly fast and simple.
       Loading an Agent is <em>also</em> simple.  There are complications
       involved in making the agent's namespace available to all documents in
       its home, especially if multiple agents share the same home.
       
       <p>In this scheme it becomes the <code>SiteMachine</code>'s
       responsibility to track down the agent associated with a directory URL
       and make it available as a <code>Namespace</code> when executing the
       documents in that directory.  Multiple agents may share a home
       directory; their namespaces will <em>all</em> be available under the
       agents' names (e.g., <code>History:</code> as well as the default
       <code>AGENT:</code>).

  <li> An Agent is a Namespace in its home Resource's configuration.  Loading
       the agent becomes trivial.  Saving it requires nothing more than
       <code>synchronize</code>, but will take longer if there's lots of other
       metadata to save.  The &lt;AGENT&gt; tag would be defined in the
       configuration tagset <code>pia-config</code>;
       <code>AgentBuilder</code>'s existing tagset-switching method will be
       sufficient to switch to the container's local tagset for the content.
       There may, again, be naming issues if there are multiple agents; it
       also means that the agent name and the namespace name will usually be
       different, with the namespace name being <code>AGENT</code> and the
       agent name being the name of the parent Container.

  <li> An Agent <em>is</em> its home Resource's configuration.  This totally
       eliminates naming issues.  We can preserve the &lt;AGENT&gt; tag, but
       it no longer needs to have a <code>name</code> attribute -- in fact it
       no longer even needs to be a namespace!  The <code>act-on</code> and
       <code>criteria</code> could be separate properties, or we could make
       <code>act-on</code> the content of &lt;AGENT&gt; and leave
       <code>criteria</code> as an attribute.  This leads to:

  <li> An Agent's <em>namespace</em> is its home Resource's properties and
       documents.  A Container (say, ``...<code>/Toolbar</code>'') can easily
       have multiple agents, because all they are is
       <code>&lt;AGENT&gt;</code> elements in the configuration.  An Agent
       becomes <em>nothing</em> but a single XML element with some contents
       that get expanded, and attributes that say <em>when</em> it gets
       expanded.  It can have optional sub-elements
       <code>&lt;initialize&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;action&gt;</code>.
</ol>

<p> Listing them in this way made it obvious that the last option is the
    correct one.
