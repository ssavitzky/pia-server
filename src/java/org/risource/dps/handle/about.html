</ul>

<h2>What a Handler Does</h2>

<p> The <a href="../Handler.java"><code>crc.dps.Handler</code></a> interface is
    actually a composite of two other interfaces:  
    <a href="../Syntax.java"><code>crc.dps.Syntax</code></a> and
    <a href="../Action.java"><code>crc.dps.Action</code></a>.

<p> Every <a href="../active/ActiveNode"><code>ActiveNode</code></a> actually
    points to two (potentially different) handlers, accessible through the
    <code>getSyntax()</code> and <code>getAction()</code> methods.

<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p> The <code>Syntax</code> interface of a Handler is invoked at <em>parse
    time</em>.  In the typical case, for an Element, it tells the parser
    whether the element is empty, whether its contents are parsed or unparsed,
    and so on.

<p> When the Parser constructs a new Node, for example an Element, it passes
    the tagname and attribute list to the Tagset using the
    <code>createActiveElement</code> method.  The tagset obtains the
    appropriate handler using its own <code>getHandlerForTag</code> method,
    and calls on the handler to construct the node, using its
    <code>createElement</code> method.

<p> <code><em>handler</em>.createElement</code> normally constructs a default
    <code>ParseTreeElement</code> object, but may be overridden to construct a
    subclass.  See <a href="tagsetHandler.java"><code>tagsetHandler</code></a>
    for an example of this. 

<p> The syntax Handler then sets the new element's action handler, using
    <code>e.setAction(getActionForNode(e));</code>.  The default is simply to
    return <code>this</code>, but the handler has a chance to check for the
    presence (though not the value) of attributes at parse time and get some
    dispatching out of the way.  See <a
    href="testHandler.java"><code>testHandler</code></a> for a good example of
    this technique.

<p> At this point, the <em>syntax</em> interface is out of the picture. 

<h3>Semantics</h3>

<p> An ActiveNode's associated <code>Action</code> handler is called from a
    Processor (or from processing utilities in <a
    href="../aux/Expand.java"><code>crc.dps.aux.Expand</code></a>, although
    in practice these almost invariably construct a sub-processor).

<p> The relevant code in <code>BasicProcessor is:</code>

<pre>
  public boolean run() {
    running = true;
    processNode();
    while (running &amp;&amp; input.toNextSibling() != null) processNode();
    return running;
  }

  /** Process the current Node */
  public final void processNode() {
    Action handler = input.getAction();
    if (handler != null) {
      additionalAction(handler.actionCode(input, this));
      // MUST BE equivalent to: handler.action(input, this, output);
    } else {
      expandCurrentNode();
    }
  }

  /** Perform any additional action requested by the action routine. */
  protected final void additionalAction(int flag) {
    switch (flag) {
    case Action.COPY_NODE: copyCurrentNode(); return;
    case Action.COMPLETED: return;
    case Action.EXPAND_NODE: expandCurrentNode(); return;
    case Action.EXPAND_ATTS: expandCurrentAttrs(); return;
    case Action.PUT_NODE: putCurrentNode(); return;
    }
  }
</pre>

<p> It is expected that any active node's handler will simply perform the
    action in its <code>actionCode</code> method, and return
    <code>Action.COMPLETED</code> to so indicate.

<hr>
<h2>Inside an Action</h2>

<p> Eventually we get down to calling the ``three-argument'' action method,
    which in <code>GenericHandler</code> (which is the parent of the handlers
    for all active elements) looks like this:

<pre>
    public void action(Input in, Context aContext, Output out) {
        defaultAction(in, aContext, out);
    }
</pre>

<p> All this is doing is passing the real operation off to
    <code>defaultAction</code>, in case you want to 

<hr>
<h2>Handler Classes</h2>

<p> There are four different kinds (classes?) of handler classes:

<ol>
  <li> Handlers for generic nodes of a given type.  These have capitalized
       names ending with <code>Handler</code>:  for example,
       <code>EntityHandler</code>, which handles entity references.

  <li> Handlers for active Elements.  These have names that match the node's
       tagname (typically), with <code>Handler</code> as a suffix to keep them
       from being confused with Java keywords.  For example,
       <code>ifHandler</code>, which handles the <code>&lt;if&gt;</code>
       element.  In general these are public classes.

  <li> Handler subclasses for handling elements with a particular attribute.
       These have names that look like:
       <code><em>tagname</em>_<em>attribute</em></code>.  For example,
       <code>numeric_sort</code>, which handles the
       <code>&lt;numeric sort&gt;</code> element.  These are almost invariably
       package-local classes, defined in the same file as their parent
       element handler.

  <li> Handler classes for sub-elements of specific elements.  These follow
       the same naming convention as handlers for other active elements,
       <em>but</em> are often defined in the same file as their parent
       element.  For example, <code>fromHandler</code>, which handles the
       <code>&lt;from&gt;</code> sub-element of <code>&lt;select&gt;</code>.
</ol>

<p> Note that several tags can share a handler class by specifying the classname
    explicitly.  For example, <code>&lt;else-if&gt;</code> and
    <code>&lt;elsif&gt;</code> share the same handler.  It is also possible to
    construct variant tagsets in which every element has a different name than
    the ``standard'' one.  Because of this, when a parent handler wants to
    identify specific sub-elements, it will usually compare the class names of
    their handlers instead of their tagnames.  See <code>ifHandler</code> for
    a good example.

<h2>Writing a Handler</h2>

<h3>Writing an Element handler</h3>

<p> When writing a new handler from scratch, say for the
    ``<code>&lt;foo&gt;</code>'' element, the best way to start is with the
    command:
<pre>
  make class tag=<em>foo</em>
</pre>

<p> This copies a skeleton called <code>TypicalHandler</code>, replacing all
    occurrances of ``<code>typical</code>'' with ``<code>foo</code>'' and so
    giving you a good place to start.

<p> The new class will have a <code>getActionForNode</code> method to dispatch
    on attributes at parse time, and a sample attribute-handler subclass.
    Either edit the names, or delete them if you don't want them.

<p> The skeleton gives you a ``five-argument'' <code>action</code> method to
    customize.  This is almost always the right place to start; you can do
    anything with it, but it may be less efficient than a customized
    ``three-argument'' action.  In particular, if you need the contents of the
    element as a string it is <em>significantly</em> more efficient to make a
    three-argument action routine; see <code>testHandler</code> and its
    subclasses for some typical examples.

<p> If you need to do something involving control structure, take a look at
    <code>repeatHandler</code> and <code>ifHandler</code>.  If you need to
    pass data between an element and its sub-elements, or from one sub-element
    to another, look at <code>selectHandler</code>. 

<h3>Writing an Attribute or sub-element handler</h3>

<p> When writing a handler for an attribute or sub-element, the best thing to
    do is to clone an existing one with the same parent.

<p> If you need to add sub-elements to a <em>new</em> parent element, take a
    look at <code>selectHandler</code>.

<h3>Getting Information</h3>

<ul>
  <li> If you need information about the current node (for example, its node
       type or tagname), use the current <code>Input</code> (usually passed as
       an argument called <code>in</code>).  The input is also the right place
       to go for conversions, e.g.
       <pre>
           ActiveElement e = in.getActive().asElement();
       </pre>

  <li> If you need the value of an entity, or need to set an entity, use the
       current <code>Context</code> (usually called either <code>cxt</code> or
       <code>aContext</code>).

  <li> If you need something from the current <code>Tagset</code>, use
       <code>cxt.getTopContext().getTagset()</code>.

</ul>

<hr>
<h2>Debugging</h2>

<p> You can always get debugging information output using the
    <code>debug</code> or <code>message</code> methods on
    <code>Context</code>.  Note, however, that any computations involved in
    computing the message will be executed whether debugging is turned on or
    not.  It is usual, therefore, to comment out debugging statements after
    you're done with them.
