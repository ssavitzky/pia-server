</ul>

<h2>Philosophy</h2>

The DPS has several ways of looking at a document:

<ul>
  <li> As a character stream
  <li> As a parse tree
  <li> As a program, which ``expands'' (evaluates) to a document.
</ul>

An InterForm could be viewed as an active document (program) which expands
into a character stream.  The easy way to implement an InterForm under this
view would be to use the <code>toString</code> method on <code>Node</code>.
Active nodes would simply expand appropriately by overriding the
<code>toString</code> method, and everything would be cool.  <p>

There are several problems with this:
<ol>
  <li> In some cases the InterForm is represented as a stream (file), and we
       want to expand it ``on the fly''.
  <li> In other cases, we want the result to be another parse tree. 
  <li> In yet other cases, we want the result to be something else altogether,
       for example nothing (evaluation for side effects), a bitmap (rendering
       on the screen or for print), or a totally transformed document in a file.
  <li> Sometimes we want to do all three:  expand into a stream, modify the
       original InterForm parse tree itself, and store the modified parse tree
       back into the original file.
  <li> What's worse, we want to be able to process the same document in
       different ways (e.g. expanding it or pretty-printing it), using
       different definitions for its tags.
</ol>

As a result, we prefer to view an InterForm as an ActiveDocument composed of
Nodes (some of) which implement the ActiveNode interface.  <em>Active</em>
nodes simply expand into more nodes.  The classes whose names start with
``<code>ParseTree</code>'' in <code>org.risource.dps.active</code> implement the
<code>ActiveNode</code> interface. <p>

The efficient way to accomplish this kind of processing is to use a parse tree
<em>traverser</em> as an <code>Input</code>, and a <em>constructor</em> of
some sort for an <code>Output</code>.  This avoids actually constructing nodes
or nodelists until they are really needed.  (Attribute lists, in particular,
will usually have to be constructed, but the attributes themselves can be
shared so the overhead is small.  Nodes in child lists <em>cannot</em> be
shared, but we use traversal to avoid constructing them in most cases.) <p>

The default action for a node is to copy it (recursively, if necessary) from
the current <code>Input</code> to the current <code>Output</code>.  Active
nodes have an <code>action</code> routine that performs any necessary
computation, and puts the results on the <code>Output</code>.

<h3>Local Transformations</h3>

Active nodes in the DPS all have the characteristic that they implement
<em>local</em> functions:  at most they will be replaced by a NodeList.<p>

If it can be determined at parse time that a node contains no children
with side effects, all the children of that node can be expanded in
parallel. <p> 

In any case, a document in which all active nodes are local can be processed
in a single depth-first, left-to-right traversal. 


<h2>Implementation:</h2>

<h3>Processing Overview</h3>

The fundamental implementation is to <em>traverse</em> an active document
(ParseTree) using a kind of iterator called an <code>Input</code> An
<code>Input</code> is basically a specialized version of the DOM's
<code>TreeIterator</code> <em>except:</em>

<ul>
  <li> It may be unidirectional, implementing only the navigation operations
       <ul>
	 <li> <code>toNextSibling</code>
	 <li> <code>toParent</code>
	 <li> <code>toFirstChild</code>
       </ul>
  <li> Rather than directly returning the next Node, it is possible to
       <em>query</em> it to determine its node type, string data, and
       whether it has children or attributes.
  <li> If <code>input.hasChildren()</code> returns <code>true</code> but
       <code>input.getNode().hasChildren()</code> returns <code>false</code>,
       we know that <code><em>input</em></code> is a parser, and that
       the current node's children have not been seen yet.
  <li> The following all return implementations of ActiveNode:
       <ul>
	 <li> <code>getNode</code> -- a reference to the actual current node
	      in the parse tree.  It is possible that not all of its children
	      will be present.
	 <li> <code>getTree</code> -- a reference to the same object as
	      getNode, except that it is guaranteed that all of its children
	      are present. 
       </ul>
</ul>

(Note that <code>TreeIterator</code> has been dropped from recent
versions of the DOM Level 1, but it's still a good idea.)<p>

Similarly, the output is constructed by means of an <code>Output</code>.  This
combines traversal with construction, so that it is possible to add a node to
the document under construction, then go on to add its children. <p>

This means that Output needs <code>startNode</code> and <code>endNode</code>
as well as <code>putNode</code> (which adds a complete subtree).  <p>

A <code>Parser</code> is simply a specialized <code>Input</code> that
implements the standard operations by parsing an input stream.  It does
<em>not</em> have to build an actual tree.  Similarly, an <code>Output</code>
need not be a tree constructor; it might simply output a text representation
of the node to an output stream. <p>

An action routine will normally obtain its ``arguments'' (i.e. the attributes
and children of the node that invoked it) by way of a suitable Output.  This
could then be returned to the action routine's calling context as a
continuation.  In any case, the Output is strongly typed, so the action
routine can obtain the relevant objects (e.g. ActiveElement, NodeList, etc.)
knowing their exact types.<p>


<h3>Algorithms:</h3>

The basic main loop, without evaluation, is:

<h4>copyNodes(input, output)</h4>
<ol>
  <li> input.hasChildren?
       <dl>
	 <dt> yes:
	 <dd> output.startNode
	      <ol>
		<li> input.toFirstChild
		<li> copyNodes(input, output)
		<li> input.toParent
	      </ol>
	      output.endNode
	 <dt> no:
	 <dd> output.putNode
       </dl>
  <li> input.toNextSibling <em>(get a new node)</em>
  <li> repeat until no more siblings
</ol>

This can be done iteratively by just keeping track of nesting depth, although
it's probably simpler to do it recursively.<p>

The basic main loop for evaluation reduces to <code>copyNodes</code> if no
active nodes are present:

<h4>processNodes(input, context, output)</h4>
<ol>
  <li> node = input.getNode <em>(get a new node)</em>
  <li> node.hasAction?
       <dl>
	 <dt> yes:
	 <dd> node.action(input, context, output)
	 <dt> no:
	 <dd> <em>(copy and process)</em>
	      <ol>
		<li> input.hasChildren?
		     <dl>
		       <dt> yes:
		       <dd> output.startNode
			    <ol>
			      <li> input.toFirstChild
			      <li> processNodes(input, context, output)
			      <li> input.toParent
			    </ol>
			    output.endNode
		       <dt> no:
		       <dd> output.putNode
		     </dl>
	      </ol>
       </dl>
  <li> node = input.toNextSibling <em>(get a new node)</em>
  <li> if (n != null) process(input, context, output)
</ol>

<p><code>processNodes</code> is actually a method of the interface
<code>org.risource.dps.Process</code>.  <code>Process</code> in turn <em>extends</em>
<code>Context</code>, and has <code>input</code> and <code>output</code> as
instance variables.  This makes the code as implemented somewhat less clear
than that given above.  An additional complication is the fact that a node's
``action'' is actually contained in a separate object (the ``handler'') which
the node points to. 

<p>It is the responsibility of the node's action handler to obtain and process
its contents if necessary.  This is done by constructing a ``subProcess'' with
the original input, and a nodelist as output.  It is possible to further
simplify the processing, at the expense of efficiency, by insisting that every
``passive'' node have an action that simply performs the ``copy and process''
step.  (In fact, every passive node <em>does</em> have such an action, but
we test for several common cases using the <code>actionCode</code> method.) 

<p>A node's action is either a ``primitive'' (which executes at this point), or
is specified by an ``action list'' of nodes (some of which may be active).  In
the latter case, the original node's attribute list and processed content list
are bound to the local variables (entities) <code>attributes</code> and
<code>content</code> respectively, and a new subProcess is constructed with
the action list as input and the original output as output.

<p>The typical node action, then, is:

<h4>action(input, context, output)</h4>
<ol>
  <li> atts = getProcessedAttributes(input, context)
  <li> input.hasChildren?
       <ol> <em>(process and collect children)</em>
	 <li> content = new NodeList;
	 <li> input.toFirstChild
	 <li> process(input, context, content)
	 <li> input.toParent
       </ol>
  <li> <em>(Construct new context; bind entities)</em>
       <ol>
	 <li> p = context.subProcess;
	 <li> p.set("attributes", atts)
	 <li> p.set("content", content)
       </ol>
  <li> process(actions, p, output) <em>(process action list)</em>
</ol>

Some (primitive) node actions may require the content in a different form, for
example a string.  In this case they simply use a different type of object as
their output.<p>

Again, there are several complications in the actual code.  For example,
NodeList cannot (presently) be used as either an input or an output; it has to
be wrapped in an iterator. <p>


<h3>Structure Sharing and Copying</h3>

<p>Because of the way the DOM is designed, with nodes linked to their parent
and siblings, it is essentially impossible to share structure.  If a node is
part of an existing document tree and needs to be added to a new one, it has
to be recursively copied.  This is inefficient, so the DPS only copies nodes
when it is actually building structure.

<p>The main exception to this at present is attribute lists -- these are
represented as instances of <code>ParseTreeAttrs</code>, which is essentially
an array.  Hence attributes can be shared.  Attribute <em>lists</em>, however,
have to be copied in order to prevent changes made to the attributes of one
element from being reflected in those of its copies.  Fortunately, attribute
lists are fairly light-weight.  

<p>A major advantage of this implementation is that, if a document consists
primarily of text and ordinary ``passive'' markup, the entire parse tree is
never actually constructed.  Passive nodes can flow directly from the input to
the output without having to be copied.  This is partly because an
<code>Input</code> can be queried about the ``effective'' structure
(i.e. whether a node has children), while actually handing out an ``orphan''
node with no parent and no children, ready to be inserted into a new
tree by the <code>Output</code>.

<hr>
<h2> Alternative Implementations</h2>

<p>There are two main alternative implementation techniques.

<h3>Recursive Tree Expansion</h3>

<p>One alternative implementation would be to generate a complete parse tree,
with each node having an ``<code>expand</code>'' method that recursively
expands the node and its children, putting the results on an
<code>Output</code>.  This is similar to the standard OO technique of having
every object know how to ``print itself'' on an output stream.

<p>The disadvantage of this approach is that a document's entire parse tree
has to reside in memory.  The advantage is that most, if not all, context can
be kept on the execution stack.

<p>An extreme variation on this technique is to <em>compile</em> the original
document into an equivalent program, and then execute it.

<h3>Event Driven</h3>

<p>Many parsers (including all SGML parsers conforming to the SAX interface
standard) operate by calling an ``action routine'' for each of the following
``events'':

<ol>
  <li> encountering a start tag
  <li> encountering an end tag
  <li> encountering some other node
</ol>

<p>They are, in other words, calling on the equivalent of an
<code>Output</code> to perform their processing.  It would be possible to
rewrite our processing algorithm so that an <code>Output</code> could do the
necessary processing without needing an <code>Input</code>.  It would then be
operating in ``push mode''.

<p>There are several variations on this technique:

<ol>
  <li> The first is to separate the action for each active node into a
       ``start action'' and an ``end action''.  In between, a processed parse
       tree is constructed for the content.  Most of the work happens in the
       end action; the processor's state consists mainly of a stack of
       partially-constructed trees. 

  <li> The second is to have the ``start action'' <em>return</em> a new
       <code>Output</code> as a continuation, pushing the previous
       output on a stack.  Performing an end tag event on such an output
       would result in the end action being performed and the previous
       output being popped.  This can be significantly more efficient if
       special processing has to be done on an active tag's content.

  <li> The third, which we actually implemented for our first ``InterForm
       Interpretor'', is to have the event routines construct a sequence of
       ``token'' objects that are then fed to the processor (which associates
       separate actions with them).  This has the disadvantage that objects
       are constructed for the end tags, then immediately thrown away.

  <li> The fourth, by far the simplest to derive from the present code, is to
       put the parser and processor in separate threads.  The ``event-driven''
       <code>Input</code> simply blocks until the parser thread provides it
       with a node.
