  <li> 1998-06-12 <b>Bug:</b>  true branch of &lt;if&gt; failing. <br>
       (1998-06-11) <br>
       -- This turned out to be due to the fact that, unlike
          <code>java.util.Enumeration</code>, a <code>NodeEnumerator</code>
          skips the first item if you start with <code>getNext</code> instead
          of <code>getFirst</code>.

  <li> 1998-06-12 <b>Check:</b>  Loops with NodeEnumerator <br>
       Loops involving a <code>NodeEnumerator</code> have to
       start with <code>getFirst</code> -- <code>getNext</code> skips the
       first element (unlike a <code>java.util.Enumeration</code>)!
       (1998-06-12)
       
  <li> 1998-06-12 <b>Bug:</b> <code>testHandler</code> <br>
       &lt;test&gt;foo&lt;/test&gt; returns 11 -- extra put, perhaps.
       (1998-06-11) <br>
       -- Missing return, actually, after the test for null attribute list.

  <li> 1998-06-15 <b>Bug:</b> entity substitution <br>
       &amp;date; not getting substituted (i.e. not getting looked up) in
       running text, but substituted correctly in attributes.
       (1998-06-11) <br>
       -- Caused by AbstractHandler not checking for NodeType == ENTITY.

  <li> 1998-06-15 <b>Bug:</b> nested &lt;if&gt; <br>
       The correct branch is selected, but appears twice in the output.
       (1998-06-12) <br>
       -- [copying a node that actually has children should just do a putNode
	  and not recurse.]

  <li> 1998-06-15 <b>Bug:</b> &lt;if text&gt; <br>
       any element in the condition appears to be considered true.
       (1998-06-12) <br>
       -- Incorrect dispatching:  wasn't dispatching if no subtype attr.
          This meant that <code>text</code>, specifically, wasn't handled.

  <li> 1998-06-15 <b>Hole:</b> <code>Filter</code> parse tree output <br> 
       parse tree input &amp; output should use serialized object streams.
       (1998-06-15) <br>
       -- The <code>-n</code> option was added to permit parsing but not
          expanding an input file.

  <li> 1998-06-16 <b>Hole:</b> get/set)IndexValue  <br>
       Should do this using utils in <code>org.risource.dps.aux.Index</code>.

  <li> 1998-06-17 <b>Hole:</b> <code>org.risource.dps.active</code> as DOM <br>
       Fairly soon we will want to expand ParseTree* to a full DOM
       implementation, and make it completely independent from the
       implementations in <code>org.risource.dom</code>. <br>
       -- completed 6/17 with some bugs remaining, and no impl. of Document.

  <li> 1998-06-17 <b>Impr:</b> <code>AbstractActiveNode</code> deepCopy <br>
       <code>deepCopy</code> should use a method in the abstract parent to
       copy the children.  The reason it doesn't now is that the existing
       method meant for that purpose is in <code>org.risource.dom.AbstractNode</code>,
       and doesn't constructive active nodes.  It uses <code>clone</code>, and
       it's broken. <br>
       -- fixed with the re-parenting of the <code>ParseTree</code> classes.

  <li> 1998-06-18 <b>Bug:</b> Bugs with independent ParseTree DOM <br>
       After making ParseTreeElement, etc. descend from ParseTreeNode, empty
       elements are not identified, and &lt;test match&gt; produces odd
       results.  Start tags are getting replaced by end tags in some cases!
       (1998-06-17) <br>
       -- <code>isEmptyElement</code> is never getting set.  Do it in
	  <code>AbstractParser</code>'s <code>createActiveElement</code> and
	  <code>correctActiveElement</code>. 

  <li> 1998-06-18 <b>Impr:</b>  <code>EntityHandler</code> needed <br>
       having a specific handler for expandable entities would help a lot.
       It is expected that this would result in a substantial speedup.
       (1998-06-15) <br>
       -- In all about 5 seconds (15%) off parsing from other improvements,
          and 6 off processing from this one.

  <li> 1998-06-18 <b>Impr:</b>  <code>TextHandler</code> needed <br>
       -- no noticable speed improvement.

  <li> 1998-06-18 <b>Impr:</b>  Remove debugging code from inner loops. <br>
       -- Removing debug calls in <code>processNode</code> and
	  <code>additionalAction</code> saves another 30%! (sick.)

  <li> 1998-06-18 <b>Hole:</b> PUT_NODE action code needed <br>
       Passive node with no children -- just put it. 
       (1998-06-18) <br>

  <li> 1998-06-18 <b>Hole:</b> ParseTreeNode must allow extra action on
       addChild, insertBefore, and initialization. <br>
       This will allow insertion methods to be extended.  Only the protected
       dispatch method <code>doInsert</code> needs to be extended.
       (1998-06-19) <br>

  <li> 1998-06-18 <b>Hole:</b> Tagset and Handler must be generic. <br>
       Sometimes we may need them to be elements, sometimes declarations.
       (1998-06-18) <br>

  <li> 1998-06-18 <b>Hole:</b> Tagset and EntityTable must be lists as
       well. <br> 
       The items defined must be their content, not their attributes.
       This will greatly simplify the loading of tagsets, DTD's, etc.
       (1998-06-19) <br>

  <li> 1998-06-22 <b>Impr:</b> Define syntax flags in
       <code>org.risource.dps.Syntax</code> <br> 
       (They are currently defined in BasicTagset, which makes them mostly
       inaccessible.)
       (1998-06-18) <br>

  <li> 1998-06-23 <b>Bug:</b> entities and attributes broken <br>
       Something broke when we went to values not being children.  Values are
       set, but cannot be retreived.  Several places seem to still be using
       getChildren instead of getValue.
       (1998-06-23) <br>
       -- tested old value for null instead of new, in <code>putValue</code>.

  <li> 1998-06-23 <b>Bug:</b> &lt;test match&gt; produces odd results.  <br>
       &lt;test match&gt; produces odd results sometimes in <code>t2.if</code>
       (1998-06-17) <br>
       -- due to attributes being broken, of course.

  <li> 1998-06-24 <b>Bug:</b> Nested &lt;if&gt; loses &lt;then&gt; content. <br>
       The children of a second-level then are getting lost instead of copied.
       (1998-06-23) <br>
       -- declaring <code>int action</code> instead of
          <code>int actionCode</code>

  <li> 1998-06-24 <b>Impr:</b> &lt;test&gt; should be ended by &lt;then&gt; <br>
       (1998-06-18) <br>

  <li> <b>Check:</b>  copying <br>
       Non-processed parse trees (e.g. &lt;else&gt;) should never be copied.
       Copying should use <code>putNode</code> if the node actually has
       children; recursion if the children are unparsed.
       (1998-06-15)<br>

  <li> 1998-06-25 <b>Impr:</b> Dispatching: create fewer instances <br>
       Dispatching should create a new handler instance only when necessary;
       normally it should cache instances with standard attributes.
       (1998-06-15) <br>
       -- <code>handle(<em>element</em>)</code> method in place; usage needs
	  to be checked.

  <li> 1998-06-25 <b>Query:</b>  &lt;test zero&gt; non-number&lt;/&gt; = ?<br>
       Not clear whether non-numerics should test as zero or not.  The most
       consistant thing would be for whitespace to return <code>true</code>,
       non-whitespace to return <code>false</code>.
       (1998-06-15)
       -- At the moment, whitespace is zero.
       
  <li> 1998-06-26 <b>Bug:</b> Empty actor def's fail. <br>
       (1998-06-25) <br>
       -- Empty def. handled by defining as null string. 

  <li> 1998-06-27 <b>Bug:</b> Actors defined inside &lt;if&gt; fail. <br>
       One can no longer expect an actor defined inside quotes to be visible
       there (because of pre-parsing), but it <em>should</em> be visible
       <em>outside</em>. 
       (1998-06-25) <br>
       -- <code>ParseTreeText</code> wasn't getting cloned correctly; a
	  hangover from when it descended from BasicText.

  <li> 1998-06-27 <b>Bug:</b> Parsing:  Lots of trouble with implicit end.<br>
       &lt;tr&gt; ends the previous &lt;th&gt;, but neither the expected
       &lt;/tr&gt; nor the &lt;tr&gt; show up.  An entity before an inserted
       &lt;/td&gt; also causes havoc -- it turns into a comment! (probably bad
       node type).  Missing &lt;/then&gt; also loses.
       (1998-06-26) <br>
       -- Not putting token back into <code>next</code> in
	  <code>advanceParser</code>.

  <li> 1998-06-27 <b>Goal:</b> (7-1) Able to process slides <br>
       Be able to process <code>.../Reviews/slides-199807.html</code> in time
       to show it at the review.  Requires &lt;actor&gt;
       (1998-06-24) <br>

  <li> 1998-07-05 <b>Impr:</b> <code>Tagset</code> should not extend
       <code>DOMFactory</code>. <br>
       Besides; DOMFactory is going away.
       (1998-06) <br>

  <li> 1998-07-07 <b>Impr:</b> Pre-load tagset and handler classes. <br>
       Probably best done by having explicit tagset and handler cache classes.
       (1998-07-07) <br>

  <li> 1998-07-09 <b>Hole:</b> PIA transition from old to new interp. <br>
       Agents need to know which interpretor (and tagset, of course) they
       should be using.  Hooks can be distinguished by type.
       (1998-06-18) <br>

  <li> 1998-07-08 <b>Hole:</b> PIA Content in push mode. <br>
       <code>org.risource.pia.Content</code> currently operates in pull mode, expecting
       to read from an input stream.  For the DPS it needs to run in push
       mode, giving the DPS a suitable output stream and letting it run.
       (1998-06-18) <br>
       -- (Actually, Content always did the right thing; it was just
	  <code>StreamContent</code> that didn't.  The alternative, though,
	  never handled insertions correctly.)

  <li> 1998-07-15 <b>Impr:</b> &lt;test iftrue/iffalse&gt; not needed. <br>
       The <code>iftrue</code> and <code>iffalse</code> attributes are both
       unnecessary and unused.
       (1998-07-15) <br>

  <li> 1998-07-17 <b>Impr:</b> Move Processor implementations to subdir. <br>
       (1998-07-08) <br>
       -- moved to <code>org.risource.dps.process</code>
      
  <li> 1998-07-20 <b>Bug?:</b> XML PI's need to end in `<code>?&gt;</code>' <br>
       present parser ends them with `<code>&gt;</code>'.
       (1998-07-16)<br>
       -- This may be a misunderstanding.  Certainly in generic SGML, PI's end
	  with plain `<code>&gt;</code>', and even some XML documentation so
	  specifies.  The XML identifier, however, definitely does require a ?.
       <p>

  <li> <b>Wish:</b> <code>ParseTreeGenericNode</code> <br>
       Eventually there should be a ParseTreeGenericNode, basically Token, so
       that we can build trees with arbitrary node types.
       <br>

  <li> 1998-07-22 <b>Bug:</b> XML names include extra characters. <br>
       XML names may contain `<code>"." | "-" | "_" | ":"</code>' in addition
       to anything Unicode defines as a letter, combining character, or
       extender.  Colon is the namespace delimiter, and the prefix "xml" is
       reserved.  HTML4.0 has these, too.
       (1998-07-16)<br>

  <li> 1998-07-22 <b>Hole:</b> Parser must call createElement with attr list. <br>
       <code>correctActiveElement</code> is evil.
       (1998-07-22)<br>

  <li> 1998-07-31 <b>Hole:</b> need HookProcessor to run Agent hooks. <br>
       (1998-07-08) <br>

  <li> 1998-08-10 <b>Bug:</b> need to give an error on missing handlers. <br>
       (1998-08-04) <br>

  <li> 1998-08-11 <b>Impr:</b> tag handler classes need loader methods <br>
       Tagset shouldn't have to know how to load classes for handlers.  Having
       static methods for this would allow tag handlers to manage their own
       name spaces. 
       (1998-06-16) <br>

  <li> 1998-08-11 <b>Hole:</b> New Handlers <br>
       A significant amount of language design is needed here.
       <br>
       The language design is done and the basics are working; missing
       handlers are now at the level of bugs.

  <li> 1998-08-11 <b>Hole:</b> Loading Tagset from file <br>
       <br>
       The language design is done and the basics are working; missing
       handlers are now at the level of bugs.

  <li> 1998-08-11 <b>Bug:</b> Tagset files don't have search path. <br>
       Need to check <code>.tss</code> and <code>.tso</code> files.
       (1998-08-11) <br>

  <li> 1998-08-12 <b>Bug:</b> Tagsets don't handle bad <code>.tso</code> files. <br>
       Need to try a separate load so we can fall back on <code>.tss</code> or
       <code>.ts</code> if the <code>.tso</code> file causes exceptions.
       (1998-08-11) <br>

  <li> 1998-08-12 <b>Bug:</b> Tagsets not loaded from resources. No search path. <br>
       Need to be able to use class loader; check <code>.tss</code> and
       <code>.tso</code> files.
       (1998-08-11) <br>

  <li> 1998-08-12 <b>Bug:</b> <code>implied</code> -&gt; <code>optional</code> <br>
       Check the semantics of <code>implied</code> in SGML.  In any case it's
       not clear; ``optional'' is better. 
       (1998-08-12) <br>

  <li> 1998-08-13 <b>Prop:</b> New InterForm extensions (?). <br>
       (of course, one really obvious one is <code>.dpml</code> -- Document
       Processing Markup Language. (6-29)
       <dl>
	 <dt> .xh (mh?)
	 <dd> ``eXecutable HTML'' (``Meta-HTML'') -- resulting in a MIME type of
	      <code>text/html</code> 
	 <dt> .xx (mx?)
	 <dd> ``eXecutable SML (``Meta-XML'') -- resulting in a MIME type
	      appropriate for XML. 
	 <dt> .xm (md?) [not done yet]
	 <dd> ``eXecutable MIME'' (``Meta-Data'') -- the MIME header is
	      returned as part of the document
       </dl>
       (1998-06-18) <br>

  <li> 1998-08-13 <b>Hole:</b> Namespaces in Entities, Get, Set. <br>
       Easy thing is to make an entity with a name ending in colon a namespace
       entity.  Look them up as usual.  As long as a namespace implements
       NamedNodeList we're cool (except that in fact AttributeList doesn't).
       (1998-08-12)<br>
       -- The code is written, but may be flaky.
	  <code>org.risource.dps.Namespace</code> needed for clean implementation.

  <li> 1998-08-13 <b>Hole:</b> Must define tags at parse time to cache trees. <br>
       In order to parse correctly, you have to have the whole DTD in advance.
       Yet another argument for the position that a tagset is a DTD.
       (1998-06-25) <br>
       -- This is handled by recursive tagsets. 

  <li> 1998-08-13 ~ <b>Goal:</b> (8-1) Run Most Agents <br>
       Be able to run all of the agents in (my) daily use (i.e. history, etc.,
       but not the wacko stuff in the form server).
       (1998-06-24) <br>
       -- superceded by the push to revise the language rather than work on
	  the legacy tagset, which may never be completed.

  <li> 1998-08-?? <b>Bug:</b> Flag unimplemented legacy options. <br>
       Unimplemented legacy options in &lt;get&gt; etc. have to be brought to
       the user's attention with error messages.  Requires a mode flag or,
       better, dispatching via the legacy handler first.
       (1998-06-24)<br>
       -- Note that static caching allows the correct handler class to be
	  loaded without having to hack the search order in
	  <code>loadHandler</code>. 

  <li> 1998-08-?? <b>Bug:</b> replaceChild when redefining entity or handler<br>
       BasicTagset and BasicEntityTable have to do a replaceChild when
       replacing a binding.
       (1998-06-26)<br>
       -- There are problems with sharing. 

  <li> 1998-08-13 ~ <b>Impr:</b> Character Entities should be defined in tagset <br>
       Should have defined value; copy value into references to short-circuit
       lookup.  <code>TextUtil.expandCharacterEntities</code> can then make
       use of this.
       (1998-06-22) <br>
       -- Superceded by passive entities and the need to define entities in
	  tagsets. 

  <li> 1998-08-13 ~ <b>Impr:</b> Entities need to be initialized by the Tagset. <br>
       The justification for this is that strictly speaking entities are
       defined in the DTD.
       (1998-06-18) <br>
       -- Superceded by the need to define entities in tagsets. 

  <li> 1998-08-13 <b>Hole:</b> Passive [character+] entity class, handler <br>
       Having a separate node class and handler class for character entities
       would simplify inserting and expanding them.  Would break some legacy
       code, though.
       (1998-06-19) <br>
       -- Code present but may not be debugged.

  <li> 1998-08-13 ~  <b>Wish:</b> <code>toNextNode</code>  <br>
       Might want flag in Input's that tells whether the current node has been
       processed yet.  (really relevant only for toNextNode, to keep track of
       whether we've enumerated the children yet)
       <br>
       -- probably a bad idea.

  <li>  Should eliminate the ``7-argument'' action. <br>
       At this point there is nothing using all of its arguments, so it's
       wasteful.  Should have methods on BasicHandler to get attrs, content or
       content string, etc.  Only substHandler and testHandler use cstring.
       (1998-08-12)<br>
       -- methods on BasicHandler not needed, since they are all in Expand.

  <li> 1998-08-25 <b>Bug:</b> Test.trueValue, etc. need context. <br>
       otherwise there is no way to tell whether an entity has a value.
       (1998-08-25)<br>

  <li> 1998-08-27 <b>Bug:</b> Parser.getNextSibling must parse children. <br>
       If current node has unparsed children, the parser must consume them in
       order to get over to the next sibling. 
       (1998-08-27)<br>
       -- Required adding sawChildren flag to CursorStack.

  <li> 1998-09-02 <b>Hole:</b> Sorting unimplemented. <br>
       (1998-08-12)<br>
       -- implemented by Pam
       
  <li> 1998-09-03 <b>Hole:</b> Need a Namespace interface <br>
       This will greatly simplify Index.  Also should have a method
       <code>Context.getNamespace</code>.  It would look at not only the
       entities in each context, but the name of the EntityTable nodes.
       (1998-08-12)<br>
       -- Some testing needs to be done.

  <li> 1998-09-03 <b>Bug:</b> Numeric repeat has problems <br>
       Doesn't use &amp;n; for iteration var; not recognized if
       <code>stop</code> is only attribute present.
       (1998-09-03)<br>

  <li> 1998-09-03 <b>Bug: </b> Test as condition in if is always true. <br>
       (1998-09-03) <br>
       -- This was introduced when rewriting &lt;if&gt; to use the
	  three-argument <code>action</code> method. 

  <li> 1998-09-04 <b>Hole:</b> &lt;select&gt; unimplemented. <br>
       Needs to implement everything in XPointer spec, at least.
       (1998-08-12)<br>

  <li 1998-09-08> <b>Hole:</b> Namespace changes needed. <br>
       Tagset wants to extend Namespace (sigh).  Index -&gt; namespace.
       Changes in &lt;get&gt;, &lt;set&gt;, etc.
       (1998-08-05)<br>

  <li> 1998-09-09 <b>Bug:</b> XML empty flag not recognized <br>
       At least on &lt;for&gt; elements.  Not checking in
       <code>AbstractHandler.isEmptyElement</code>
       (1998-09-04) <br>

       If the very first node in a file is active, it is just copied.  If it's
       inside a passive element it gets expanded.  
       (1999-06-15) <br>
       -- BasicProcessor.processNode calls getAction without calling getNode.
	  But getAction depended on setNode to initialize <code>action</code>.
          The solution is to call getNode at the start of run().

  <li> 1999-06-16 <b>Bug</b> Mysterious lossage involving GenericHandler <br>
       Nesting a repeat inside any passive element inside an element whose
       handler is GenericHandler (even with a definition!) causes empty
       content to be output only on the first iteration.
       (1999-06-15) <br>
       -- The problem is CurrentActive.putNode of a node that is already a
	  child of the current node.  There was ``excess cleverness'' to
	  prevent a child from being added more than once. 

  <li> 1999-06-16 <b>Bug</b> Unmatched end tag causes havoc in nodelists. <br>
       The previous node is repeatedly inserted, probably because the end tag
       isn't getting gobbled.  Happens on copy, not process; the bad end tag
       comment is repeated when quoted.  Another depth=2 effect.
       (1999-06-16) <br>
       -- The problem was the test for an already-present sibling in
	  AbstractParser.toNextSibling.
       
  <li> 1999-06-22 <b>Impr</b> Interface cleanup on Action <br>
       Remove parameters from actionCode, rename to getActionCode.  Replace
       COMPLETED with ACTIVE_NODE.
       (1999-06-22) <br>

  <li> 1999-06-22 <b>Impr</b> Interface cleanup on Cursor <br>
       remove getNode(level) -- unused.  Make to* methods return boolean.
       (1999-06-22) <br>

  <li> 1999-06-23 <b>Hole</b> Constructing and editing elements. <br>
       We want to be able to modify the attributes and content of an existing
       element, or construct a new one out of pieces.  Probably by adding back
       &lt;replace&gt; in &lt;select&gt;, and adding some new ones for value,
       insertion, etc.
       (1998-12-15) <br>

  <li> 1999-06-24 <b>Hole</b> No implementation for CDATASection. <br>
       (1999-06-24) <br>

  <li> 1999-06-24 <b>Hole</b> Comment and string handling <br>
       Need a way to get information (especially entity expansions) into
       comments and CDATA sections.  
       (1999-05-18) <br>

  <li>1999-06-25 <b>Bug</b> Need &lt;let&gt; for local setting. <br>
       Should be like &lt;set&gt; but operate in the most-local namespace.
       (1999-06-25) <br>
       
  <li> 1999-07-09 <b>Bug</b> &lt;protect markup&gt; doesn't quote content. <br>
       In other words, it's behaving like &lt;protect result markup&gt;.
       (1999-07-09) [Reported by Bill] <br>
       -- was dispatching on both attributes.  

  <li> 1999-07-14 <b>Impr:</b> Interface to push-mode parsers <br>
       Most parsers operate in push mode -- they read their input and call a
       semantic handler for each ``event''.  This requires running the
       Processor in a separate thread.
       (1998-08-13)<br>
       -- actually, we just define a new Output called "ToProcessor"

  <li> 1999-07-14 <b>Hole</b> Event-driven Processor; SAX output. <br>
       Processor needs to be an Output, and Output in turn needs to be a
       SAXApplication as well as a tree builder.  Processor needs to call
       element handler's <code>startAction</code> and <code>endAction</code>;
       on active nodes the former starts building a tree (perhaps by pushing
       something onto the Output), and the latter interprets the
       tree.  Trivial.  Need a flag of some sort that says the Processor is in
       tree-building mode; event-driven mode is indicated by the lack of an
       Input.  The flag essentially <em>has</em> to be a depth.  What we push
       on the output might be another Processor, or we might do it with a
       <code>pushInPlace</code>. 
       (1999-06-30) <br>
       -- actually, we just define a new Output called "ToProcessor"

  <li> 1999-07-14 <b>Impr</b> Output.startElement parameter change <br>
       Should take tagname and attribute list, not element node. 
       (1999-06-16) <br>

  <li> 1999-07-14 <b>Bug</b> Something can't handle a DocumentFragment on output. <br>
       Gives a comment containing the node type. 
       (1999-07-14) <br>
       -- TreeFragment didn't have toString methods.  Improved error reporting
	  in TreeNode.

  <li> 1999-08-18 <b>Impr</b> tagsetHandler should use context to load tagsets <br>
       It currently uses dps.tagset.Loader, which precludes using
       context-specific lookup.
       (1999-08-18) <br>

  <li> 1999-08-18 <b>Impr</b> Tagsets need file of origin, timestamp. <br>
       This permits an up-to-date test.
       (1999-08-18) <br>

  <li> 1999-08-18 <b>Impr</b> Simplify tagset.Loader. <br>
       remove getTagset, require -- both redundant with loadTagset.
       Add loadTagset(File, TopContext) -- needed for site stuff.
