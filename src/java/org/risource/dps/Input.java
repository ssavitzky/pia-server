/**
 * The interface for depth-first enumeration of a document or parse tree.
 *
 *	The Processor maintains a stack of Input objects from which
 *	input is obtained as needed.  An Input may have to be
 *	provided with a reference back to the Processor it is sending
 *	input to, in case it needs additional information (e.g. for
 *	parsing).  This is done during initialization and is not part
 *	of the interface. <p>
 *
 *	Note that although an Input superficially resembles the DOM's
 *	TreeIterator, the two interfaces are quite different.  A 
 *	TreeIterator is able to traverse a Document tree in any direction,
 *	whereas an Input is unidirectional and so is able to handle
 *	trees that are generated on-the-fly and that need not be retained. <p>
 *	
 *	In addition, an Input has a ``current'' node (which the TreeIterator
 *	explicitly does <em>not</em>), which can be queried and converted. <p>
 *
 *	With the use of <code>retainTree</code>, an Input parsing a document
 *	on the fly can also be forced to generate a complete Document (parse
 *	tree) as a side effect. <p>
 *
 *	Note that an Input which is being used as an Enumeration may
 *	have to ``look ahead'' to ensure that <code>hasMoreElements</code>
 *	can return an accurate result. <p>
