  <li> <b>Bug</b> Entities generated by NamespaceWrap are special <br>
       Entities generated by NamespaceWrap need to refer back to the original
       wrapped Tabular object, and re-do the <code>put</code> when their value
       is changed.
       (1999-04-16) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Extract that modifies structure should preserve list <br>
       All of the structure-modifying sub-elements should simply return the
       extracted list. 
       (1999-04-16) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> fix inheritance problems; simplify. <br>
       ActiveEntityRef shouldn't descend from ActiveValue, since it doesn't
       have one.  Namespace should extend, if not merge with, ActiveNodeMap.
       util.Expand should probably go away.  ProcessException should become
       a DPSException.
       (1999-04-07) <br>
       ActiveEntityRef fixed 4/15.  ProcessException turns out to be unused.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> XML Representations of nodes. <br>
       Tagset, Namespace, and org.risource.pia.Agent all need to be
       representable as XML.  Use &lt;ELEMENT&gt; and &lt;ENTITY&gt; tags for
       the content; construct the objects in the parser.  Dump the
       <code>*.tso</code> files in favor of <code>.tsx</code>.
       (1999-04-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Fully-cursorial processing. <br>
       Cursor needs to give complete enough access to the current node, that
       you never actually need to access the node itself.  ActiveNode needs to
       be extended with methods that return Input's instead of Node's.  Output
       needs Document-like methods to output nodes without having to create
       them first. 
       (1999-04-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Tagset inheritance by reference; copy on write. <br>
       In some cases, Tagsets should merely reference their parents, not
       include them.  In particular, this should be done when a non-tagset
       document contains &lt;define&gt; tags.
       (1999-04-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Timestamps in tagsets <br>
       Tagsets should have their filename and a timestamp so you can determine
       whether to reload them.
       (1999-04-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> unimplemented DOM components <br>
       CDATASection is unimplemented.  DOMImplementation is unimplemented.
       Large parts of TreeDocument are still unimplemented; in particular
       extracting the DocumentType and document element nodes from the content
       and putting them in their proper places.
       (1999-04-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> SAX and DOM input and output <br>
       FromSAX, FromDOM, ToSAX, ToDOM shims.
       (1999-04-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> &lt;include&gt;Directory broken <br>
       &lt;include src='~/'&gt; should give a directory listing of an agent's
       data directory.  It raises a null pointer exception instead.
       (1999-03-30) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> SGML/XML output flag <br>
       There needs to be a flag somewhere that says whether to output as SGML
       or XML. 
       (1999-03-30) <br>
       
  <li> <b>Impr</b> Need ways of getting at node names, types, keys <br>
       Mainly in &lt;extract&gt;, though a general mechanism would be good.
       It's possible that the empty &lt;extract&gt; sub-elements could be
       generalized so that they operate on their content, if present, instead
       of on &amp;list;.
       (1999-03-29) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Permanent tagsets aren't. <br>
       Need to copy the tagset when a document includes a &lt;define&gt;.
       Otherwise the PIA's permanent tagsets get polluted.
       (1999-03-29) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Really need &lt;action mode=prepend&gt; <br>
       The action should be able to edit the attributes of &amp;element;, but
       the content would then be streamed through.
       (1999-03-11) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> XML attribute names not case-sensitive. <br>
       (1999-02-24) <br>

  <li><b>Bug</b> &lt;value&gt; ignored in &lt;define entity external&gt; <br>
       The value sub-entity is ignored when using the define entity system
       attribute.   For example, the value "whatever" never gets written to file.: 
  <pre>
  &lt;define entity=pgroup system=per-group mode=create&gt;&lt;value&gt;whatever&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/define&gt;
  &pgroup;
  </pre><br>
  (1999-02-23)
  
</li>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Test atributes not all given in <code>basic.ts</code><br>
       Also, the "sorted" attribute appears to be buggy.  Perhaps it is doing
       a numeric sort instead of an alphabetic one, or not doing a split.
       (1999-02-17) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> &amp;agents; is static, not dynamic<br>
       ...so the header is wrong when agentRemove or agentInstall is used.
       This is only a problem in Agency, so we can make AGENT:agents return
       the up-to-date list.
       (1999-02-02) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Namespaces for tags <br>
       Tags need namespaces.  The namespace defined by a tagset might not be
       the same as its name; wellknown namespaces will include:
       <dl>
	 <dt> <code>dps:</code>
	 <dd> all tags defined in the <code>basic</code>, <code>xxml</code>,
	      and <code>xhtml</code> tagsets 
	 <dt> <code>pia:</code>
	 <dd> all tags defined in the <code>pia-xhtml</code> tagset.
       </dl>
       (1999-02-02) <br>


  <li> <b>Bug</b>Connect<br>
    When doing a "connect put" cannot specify src="/RHServer/persist.out"
    from an agent.  It throws an exception.  src="persist.out" does not
    throw an exception, but it does fail to write output to file.  The same
    code run using process works fine.  "connect entity" requires 
    "/RHServer/persist.out" when running from an agent.
    (1999-01-26)

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Constructing and editing elements. <br>
       We want to be able to modify the attributes and content of an existing
       element, or construct a new one out of pieces.  Probably by adding back
       &lt;replace&gt; in &lt;select&gt;, and adding some new ones for value,
       insertion, etc.
       (1998-12-15) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> passthrough action for elements. <br>
       Not at all clear how best to do this.  One possibility is lazy
       evaluation of &amp;element;.
       (1998-10-12) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Data structure elements <br>
       &lt;headers&gt;, &lt;url&gt;, etc.  need to convert text content to XML
       format, and need to output as text.
       (1998-12-14) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> lists as namespaces <br>
       Need to support two things: list tags (e.g. &lt;dl&gt;) as namespaces,
       and entities recognizing them when their value <em>contains</em> a
       namespace or name.  Would be easier if there was a simple way for the
       parser to construct arbitrary classes for elements.
       (1998-12-04) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> force tagset reloading <br>
       Is there a convenient way to force an Agent to reload its tagsets?
       Checking last-modified dates would also work, but it could get slow.
       (1998-12-04) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Persistent namespaces <br>
       There are actually two ways to make a namespace persistent:  make it
       the value of an external entity, and make its bindings be external
       entities.  In the latter case, cons up filenames from the entity
       names with a prefix.
       (1998-11-24) <br>

  <li> <b>Note</b> Tagset for external entity. <br>
       Note that an external entity can go up its parent chain to find its
       tagset.  If not given a context explicitly, it can make its own
       TopProcessor when needed.  Note that external entities do want a
       tagset; it's basically the notation.
       (1998-11-19) <br>
       -- The problem here is that the entity needs to know what TopProcessor
	  to use in order to open files; this needs to be passed at run time.

  <li> <b>Note</b> Tagset should be able to create a Processor. <br>
       They can already create their parser.  There are times when you want a
       different processor type, but in most cases the right thing will happen.
       (1998-11-19) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Resource interface. <br>
       Everything having to do with external resources (entities, connections,
       and status) would be much simpler if we had a Resource interface.
       Something like URLConnection only more versatile.
       (1998-11-18) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Assigning attributes to an entity should make namespace.<br>
       Assigning an actual AttributeList works, but using &lt;set&gt;
       doesn't.  Probably best to fix this in <code>setValue</code>.
       (1998-11-18) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Pipelined &lt;select&gt; <br>
       Should be possible to stream selection through a series of
       processors.  Bind &amp;item; to current item; evaluate
       &amp;selection; lazily as needed.  
       (1998-10-21) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> shorthand for booleans in select. <br>
       equivalent to test but with current item in content.
       (1998-10-21) <br>
 
  <li> <b>Bug</b> If/elsf/else handlers do not work correctly.  
	elsf clause always returns true.  See demo_if.xh. (1998-10-19)<br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Logical handler.  A space can change the result.  For example:
	<pre>
This version returns 1
&lt;logical and&gt;&lt;test match="abc"&gt;&name1;&lt;/test&gt;&lt;test match="bbc"&gt;&name2;&lt;/test&gt;&lt;/logical&gt;

This version returns 0
&lt;logical and&gt;&lt;test match="abc"&gt;&name1;&lt;/test&gt; &lt;test match="bbc"&gt;&name2;&lt;/test&gt;&lt;/logical&gt;
        </pre> 
	(1998-10-19)<br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Logical and.  Does not return correct (or consistent) values. With two 
	nodes, returns false; with 3 it returns the last item.  With 4 nodes (and 4th empty)
	returns nothing. If a fourth node is given, returns it.  Some examples:
	<pre>
Returns three
&lt;logical and&gt;&lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;three&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/logical&gt;

Returns nothing
&lt;logical and&gt;&lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;three&lt;/b&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/logical&gt;

If 4th node is there, returns "four".
        </pre>
	(1998-10-19)<br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Test sorted.  Returns true on an unsorted list.  For example:
	<pre>
Input: &lt;test sorted&gt;bats ants toads&lt;/test&gt; 
Result: 1 
        </pre>
	(1998-10-19)<br>

	<li> <b>Bug</b> Pad only pads on the right (align left).  For example:
<pre>
Input: &lt;pre&gt;&lt;text pad align=center width=80&gt;cat&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Results: &lt;pre&gt;cat                                                                             &lt;/pre&gt;
</pre>
(1998-11-11)<br>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> Prevent infinite loops.  Here's one way to create one:
	<pre>
&lt;repeat foreach entity=x&gt;a b c d e f g&gt;&lt;repeat&gt;&lt;for&gt;&lt;start&gt;2&lt;/start&gt;&lt;stop&gt;5&lt;/stop&gt;&x;&lt;/for&gt;&lt;/repeat&gt;&lt;/repeat&gt;
        </pre>
	(1998-10-19)<br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> no namespace for all installed agents. <br>
       Best done by making a specialized Entity that knows it's in a
       NamespaceWrap.  
       (1998-10-12) <br>
       
  <li> <b>Impr</b> Simplify Namespace and Context ops. <br>
       getEntityValue, etc. should be removed from Context; the more general
       operations in Index should be used to give a single point of
       definition. 
       (1998-10-12) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> NamespaceWrap doesn't return NodeList for bindings <br>
       (1998-10-11) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> subst has trouble with matches that get to the end. <br>
       This is a generic problem with the regexp stuff.
       (1998-10-9) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> literal element not properly terminated. <br>
       (1998-10-2) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> addMarkup has to insert real markup now. <br>
       ...because Text now converts markup characters to entities.
       (1998-10-2) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Use match to split on regexp. <br>
       &lt;text split match=<em>re</em>&gt; should convert content to a single
       string, then split on the given regexp.  This solves the problem of
       how to make <code>sep</code> consistent between <code>split</code> and
       <code>join</code>.
       (1998-09-15) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Some &lt;select&gt; subs unimplemented. <br>
       xptr is the only one left.
       (1998-09-08)<br>
       -- this can easily be deferred

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> Passive Entities needed. <br>
       Passive entities (character entities) and some normal entities have to
       be defined in the DTD.  Passive entities untested. 
       (1998-08-13) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Parser work needed. <br>
       Literals, CDATA sections, parent, content models, declaration and PI
       parsing, optionally splitting text into tokens, optional case-munging.
       (1998-08-13) <br>
       -- <code>retainTree</code> implemented 08-27 but untested.
          parent stuff (no error checking) 09-11.  literals 09-18/10-1.

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Attribute definitions. <br>
       Attribute types, implied/fixed/etc., default values, handlers.
       Dispatch table for attrs with handlers.  Lazy evaluation(?) 
       (1998-08-13)

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Interface to push-mode parsers <br>
       Most parsers operate in push mode -- they read their input and call a
       semantic handler for each ``event''.  This requires running the
       Processor in a separate thread.
       (1998-08-13)<br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Text Substitution<p>
       Needs to be done using either &lt;select&gt; or its own &lt;subst&gt;
       element with appropriate sub-elements.
       (1998-08-12)<br>
       -- (1998/08/26) handler written but no sub-elements yet.

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> Tagsets don't hack resource names correctly. <br>
       Need to decide between Class and ClassLoader conventions.  ClassLoader
       requires slashes; Class prepends module name.  Need the prepend, then
       change dots to slashes (probably in <code>org.risource.util.NameUtils</code>).
       (1998-08-12)<br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> Can't <em>use</em> a tagset. <br>
       The &lt;tagset&gt; tag only really works in a tagset definition file.
       (1998-08-11)<br>
       -- Possibly best done using a separate useTagset handler.

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> Handler class hierarchy problems. <br>
       There are two many places where we assume that all real handlers
       inherit from BasicHandler.  Fix one way or the other.
       (1998-08-13)<br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Functional programming tools. <br>
       See <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/tut/functional.html">Python</a>
       (1998-08-05)<br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> PI comments <br>
       Comments of the form <code>&lt;?-- text ?&gt;</code> should be discarded
       by the processor rather than being copied.
       (1998-07-15)<br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> PI and declaration actions <br>
       Need to assign separate actions to PI's and declarations by name.
       As a desirable side effect, this will allow loading tagsets and
       interpreting DTD's.  Strictly speaking the name is the name of an
       application, not of an operation.  PI's may have to be handled <em>even
       when passively copying</em>!
       (1998-07-15)<br>
       <p>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> Node construction <em>must</em> set handler. <br>
       All new nodes have to have their handler set properly; this means
       replacing almost all <code>new ParseTree<em>Whatever</em></code> with
       <code>create<em>Whatever</em></code> operations on the current
       Tagset. Easily enforced by eliminating constructors without handlers.
       (1998-07-10)<br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> ProcessedContent doesn't insert controls. <br>
       Neither does its predecessor, InterFormContent.
       (1998-07-08) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Add ActiveNode operations to <code>Input</code>, etc. <br>
       Fully supporting <code>ActiveNode</code> as well as <code>Node</code>
       everywhere in the DPS would give faster, simpler code.  It is already
       impossible to use ordinary DOM Nodes in a Processor.
       (1998-07-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Parser should put text in <code>next</code> <br>
       (instead of putting it in <code>nextText</code> and increasing the
       number of tests per token).
       (1998-06-29) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Ought to have <code>NamedChildList</code> <br>
       for the children of things like <code>EntityTable</code> and
       <code>Tagset</code>.
       (1998-06-29) <br>
       -- Actually it might be best to use a ParseTreeTable as a wrapper.

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> appending to undefined entity fails. <br>
       &lt;set name=foo&gt;&lt;get name=foo&gt;...&lt;/set&gt; leaves
       <code>foo</code> undefined.  There must be an explanation...
       (1998-06-26) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Upgrade <code>handle</code> methods. <br>
       The static <code>handle(<em>element</em>)</code> methods in handler
       subclasses should pick up a static instance if possible, rather than
       just calling <code>new</code>.  (See also ''Impr'' of 1998-06-15.)
       (1998-06-25) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> <code>ToParseTree</code> should take a tagset <br>
       Tagset is needed to attach actions to constructed nodes.
       (1998-06-22) <br>
       -- probably just needs working shallow copy.

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Tagset should extend EntityTable, or reference one. <br>
       This will make it easier to define entities and tags in the same DTD.
       (1998-06-19) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> PUT_VALUE action code needed <br>
       Get a value for the node and put that.  Needs a corresponding
       <code>putValue(<em>node, context, output</em>)</code> in Action; the
       default should be to copy the node.  Could be used for entity expansion
       in attributes.
       (1998-06-18) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> <code>ParseTreeDocument</code>, DTD, &amp; XML nodes. <br>
       ...are still unimplemented. 
       (1998-06-18) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Caching for subProcess stack <br>
       ContextStack should have a <code>free</code> link to a free
       sub-processor, to be used instead of allocating one.
       (1998-06-18) <br>
       -- <code>subProcess</code> clears <code>free</code>; caller does
	  <code>p.cleanup()</code> when finished to restore it.

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> <code>Filter</code> parse tree input <br> 
       Filter should  be able to read a serialized parse tree.
       (1998-06-15) <br>
       -- It should do so if the input file ends in ``<code>.xho</code>'' or
          ``<code>.xxo</code>''.
       
  <li> <b>Impr:</b> <code>NamedActiveNode</code> values <br>
       Named nodes should have defined, assigned and default values. Only
       defined value should be the children; it would be used for the
       <em>definition</em> of a name.  Want to be able to share assigned
       values; the NodeList of an assigned value would be a copy (just like we
       presently do for attribute lists, and for the same reason). 

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> <code>ParseTreeElement</code> hasActiveAttributes <br>
       ParseTreeElement should keep information about whether any of its
       attributes contain entities that need to be expanded.  Should be much
       faster, since most don't and it's known at parse time.
       The other possibility is lazy evaluation -- don't even look at them
       until they're needed when converting an attribute's value to a string.
