  <li> <b>Impr</b> Parser should use a LineNumberReader <br>
       Should also have optional filename, both for use in error messages.
       (1999-07-15) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> &lt;include src="file:..."&gt; fails for directories<br>
       There also ought to be a way to get directory content from
       &lt;status&gt;.
       (1999-07-14) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> &lt;connect&gt; gives null pointer exceptions. <br>
       (1999-07-14) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> per-Agent mappings for file extensions <br>
       Need a way to specify tagset, MIME type for various extensions
       (specifically <code>.html</code>).  Might also want a "sandbox"
       subclass of ActiveDoc that effectively makes the AGENT, PIA and tagset 
       namespaces read-only.
       (1999-07-14) [requested by Tim] <br>
       -- maybe AGENT:tagsets:html and AGENT:mime-type:html

  <li> <b>Impr</b> safeDefineHandler, safeSetHandler <br>
       Safe versions of &lt;define&gt; and &lt;set&gt; that are only able to
       define things in the current document, and with no handlers.  There
       should also be a &lt;make-safe&gt; tag to use safe versions of all
       handlers. 
       (1999-07-14) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Need action code PROCESS_NODE <br>
       This would indicate an active node with start and end actions that can
       be invoked without having to retain the node's content.  Need
       processStart and processEnd ops on Processor; something that define can
       use as well.
       (1999-07-14) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> ToProcessor untested. <br>
       (1999-07-14) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> recursive <code>define entity</code> broken <br>
       Defining an entity in terms of other entities doesn't work in a tagset,
       even if it's recursive.
       (1999-07-14) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> &lt;text encode&gt; broken on markup <br>
       It's removing all markup; for sanity, should convert to external form.
       May also not be expanding content.
       (1999-07-12) [Bill] <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> parser should report implied end tags in XML mode <br>
       (1999-07-09) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> &lt;include quoted&gt; -&gt; protect <br>
       It's inconsistent to use "quoted" here and "protect" elsewhere.  Could
       even have "<code>protect markup</code>" sucking in the file as a string
       or list of lines. 
       (1999-07-02) [Suggested by Bill] <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Reverse default of <code>case</code> attr <br>
       Make the default be case sensitive, and require
       <code>case="insensitive"</code> for insensitivity; this makes more
       sense given that, in the present regexp package, substitution cannot be
       made case-insensitive. 
       (1999-07-02) [Suggested by Bill] <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Need split and join attributes on text, etc. <br>
       Anything that processes lists should have "split" and "join"
       attributes, replacing the old "sep".
       (1999-06-29) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> nodeBuilder doesn't support all node types yet <br>
       (1999-06-24) <br>
       
  <li> <b>Bug</b> Bad end tag comment sometimes eaten. <br>
       Actually, if it's not quoted it seems to be replaced by a copy of the
       previous token. 
       (1999-06-16) <br>
       -- May have to do with a missing hasChildren test.

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Parser error verbosity level <br>
       The verbosity level of parser messages should be a tagset
       parameter: for XML they should be warnings or perhaps errors; for HTML
       most if not all should be verbose.  Similarly treatment of ommitted end
       tags and empty tags should be a parameter related to the output's DTD.
       (1999-06-16) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Null pointer error in Utilities.urlDecode <br>
       org.risource.util.Utilities.urlDecode(Utilities.java:729) called from
       text_decode.action(textHandler.java:476) on request 
       for http://blackroot.crc.ricoh.com:8888/Demo/demo_text.xh
       (1999-06-14 Pfafman) <br>
       
  <li> <b>Impr</b> Namespace attr for get, set, bind. <br>
       Note that this would allow sidestepping of XML namespace issues.
       (1999-06-11) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Parser needs error messages. <br>
       Since its a ProcessorInput it can find the Processor's
       <code>message</code> method.
       (1999-06-11) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Improved error/message handling<br>
       Create &amp;DOC:errors; entity in process.TopProcessor; Context.message 
       (implemented in util.ContextStack) should copy messages
       into it.  There should also be an entity 
       that says which verbosity level to cut off at -- call it
       &amp;verbosity; and default it to -1.  You'll need
       active.ActiveNodeList.append(), tree.TreeText.new(String), and
       Context.getBinding(String name).
       (1999-06-09) <br>
       -- In progress (Bill)

  <li> <b>Bug</b> &lt;text encode&gt; badly broken <br>
       Should be &lt;text encode=entity&gt; not &lt;encode entity&gt;.
       Also, it seems to be doing bad things to an entity in its contents, in
       some totally incomprehensible way.
       (1999-06-08) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> allowing text in attr lists preserves formatting <br>
       It would also allow the use of entities that expand to multiple
       attributes.
       (1999-05-25) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> &lt;bind&gt; doesn't build external entities <br>
       For that matter, &lt;bind&gt; has no way to build <em>any</em> value
       other than a list of ordinary nodes.  Might actually want to generate
       &lt;define&gt; for nonstandard bindings.  Or &lt;binding&gt;...
       (1999-05-25) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Need way to sync an external entity. <br>
       Presumably some version of &lt;connect&gt;, the idea being to write the
       current cached contents of the entity node.  Wanted for, e.g.,
       <code>agent-list.xml</code>.  Actually, &lt;output&gt; may be simpler.
       (1999-05-24) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> need input redecorator <br>
       needed for TopProcessor.subDocument and subDocumentEnd when the input
       is not a parser.
       (1999-05-19) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> XML Attribute handling <br>
       Almost everything currently done in the PIA using the Syntax interface
       could be done using inherited attributes.  For example, there's an
       <code>xml:space</code> attribute specifying whitespace handling. 
       (1999-05-17) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> writeup of &lt;test&gt; seriously incomplete.<br>
       For some reason it had been omitted from the table in
       <a href="/Doc/tagsets/basic.html">/Doc/tagsets/basic.html</a>!
       (1999-05-17) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> &lt;bind&gt; doesn't build embedded &lt;namespace&gt; <br>
       Because &lt;bind&gt; is quoted and &lt;namespace&gt; doesn't construct
       a namespace at parse time, this simply won't work.  Could actually emit
       a &lt;namespace&gt; tag in this case. 
       (1999-05-14) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Output wants close method. <br>
       This would simplify closing streams, writers, etc. when we're done.
       (1999-05-10) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Drop support for serialized objects <br>
       It turns out that loading XML is faster, at least for stripped tagsets.
       Any further improvements to XML processing will only widen the gap.
       (1999-05-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> XML Representation of Tagset. <br>
       Use &lt;ELEMENT&gt;, &lt;ENTITY&gt;, &lt;bind&gt; tags in content;
       construct the objects in the parser(?).  Save the flags, etc. as
       attributes.  Dump the <code>*.tso</code> files in favor of
       <code>.tsx</code>.
       (1999-05-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Namespace attribute in get, set. <br>
       This would allow the name to be literally any text.  Would require
       minor fixes in Index to allow ``:'' in namespace arg, not name.
       (1999-05-03) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> xxml additional constructs. <br>
       Eventually <code>xxml</code> should include stuff for, e.g., reading
       objects and building data structures.  
       (1999-05-03) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Need actions for PI's and Decl's <br>
       In particular, an action on &lt;!DOCTYPE....&gt; would allow
       <em>both</em> runtime selection of tagset, and<em></em> separate
       specification of the output document type.
       (1999-05-03) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Output to Writer (or ToPrint) not String. <br>
       Something like writeNode(Writer); writeStart, writeContent, writeEnd
       ops for ActiveElement.  ActiveNode.toString can just use it.  The
       start, content, end versions would have parameters (e.g. indent).
       Alternative is keeping context in a specialized Output.
       (1999-04-29) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> NamespaceWrap may need to use EntityIndirect. <br>
       (1999-04-16) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Output to file in non-existant directory fails <br>
       It should create the directory; instead it gets a null pointer
       exception in <code>Copy.copyNodes</code>, called from
       <code>connectHandler.action</code>. 
       (1999-04-20) <br>
       -- fixed in GenericAgent 4/21.  process will still have the problem.

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Entities don't have system and public ident's yet <br>
       In particular, TreeExternal needs these. 
       (1999-04-20) <br>
       -- resourceName == systemId (4/28).  Still need creation machinery.
       
  <li> <b>Impr</b> Get rid of util.Create <br>
       It's only used in three places.  All uses of createActiveNode should be
       replaced by type-specific handler classes in Tagset.  None of the
       nodelist-creation methods are used anymore.
       (1999-04-20) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Tagset should extend DocumentType <br>
       It's completely clear that in the DPS world, Tagset has all the
       attributes of a DocumentType object.
       (1999-04-20) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> fix inheritance problems; simplify. <br>
       ActiveEntityRef shouldn't descend from ActiveValue, since it doesn't
       have one.  Namespace should extend, if not merge with, ActiveNodeMap.
       util.Expand should probably go away.  ProcessException should become
       a DPSException.  Case stuff should move out of Namespace.
       (1999-04-07) <br>
       ActiveEntityRef fixed 4/15.  ProcessException turns out to be unused;
       deleted 4/16.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Fully-cursorial processing. <br>
       Cursor ought to give complete enough access to the current node that
       you never actually need to access the node itself.  ActiveNode needs to
       be extended with methods that return Input's instead of Node's.  Output
       needs Document-like methods to output nodes without having to create
       them first. 
       (1999-04-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Tagset inheritance by reference; copy on write. <br>
       In some cases, Tagsets should merely reference their parents, not
       include them.  In particular, this should be done when a non-tagset
       document contains &lt;define&gt; tags.
       (1999-04-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Timestamps in tagsets <br>
       Tagsets should have their filename and a timestamp so you can determine
       whether to reload them.
       (1999-04-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> unimplemented DOM components <br>
       CDATASection is unimplemented.  DOMImplementation is unimplemented.
       Large parts of TreeDocument are still unimplemented; in particular
       extracting the DocumentType and document element nodes from the content
       and putting them in their proper places.
       (1999-04-07) <br>
       -- CDATASection done 1999-06-24

  <li> <b>Hole</b> SAX and DOM input and output <br>
       FromDOM, ToSAX, ToDOM shims.  Note that FromDOM can be used to
       redecorate a parse tree with new semantics.  (From SAX requires an
       event-driven Processor).
       (1999-04-07) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> &lt;include&gt;Directory broken <br>
       &lt;include src='~/'&gt; should give a directory listing of an agent's
       data directory.  It raises a null pointer exception instead.
       (1999-03-30) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> SGML/XML output flag <br>
       There needs to be a flag somewhere that says whether to output as SGML
       or XML. 
       (1999-03-30) <br>
       
  <li> <b>Impr</b> Need ways of getting at node names, types, keys <br>
       Mainly in &lt;extract&gt;, though a general mechanism would be good.
       It's possible that the empty &lt;extract&gt; sub-elements could be
       generalized so that they operate on their content, if present, instead
       of on &amp;list;.
       (1999-03-29) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Really need &lt;action mode=prepend&gt; <br>
       The action should be able to edit the attributes of &amp;element;, but
       the content would then be streamed through.
       (1999-03-11) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> XML attribute names not case-sensitive. <br>
       (1999-02-24) <br>

  <li><b>Bug</b> &lt;value&gt; ignored in &lt;define entity external&gt; <br>
       The value sub-entity is ignored when using the define entity system
       attribute.   For example, the value "whatever" never gets written to file.: 
  <pre>
  &lt;define entity=pgroup system=per-group mode=create&gt;&lt;value&gt;whatever&lt;/value&gt;&lt;/define&gt;
  &pgroup;
  </pre><br>
  (1999-02-23)
  
</li>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Test atributes not all given in <code>basic.ts</code><br>
       Also, the "sorted" attribute appears to be buggy.  Perhaps it is doing
       a numeric sort instead of an alphabetic one, or not doing a split.
       (1999-02-17) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> &amp;agents; is static, not dynamic<br>
       ...so the header is wrong when agentRemove or agentInstall is used.
       This is only a problem in Agency, so we can make AGENT:agents return
       the up-to-date list.
       (1999-02-02) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Namespaces for tags <br>
       Tags need namespaces.  The namespace defined by a tagset might not be
       the same as its name; wellknown namespaces will include:
       <dl>
	 <dt> <code>dps:</code>
	 <dd> all tags defined in the <code>basic</code>, <code>xxml</code>,
	      and <code>xhtml</code> tagsets 
	 <dt> <code>pia:</code>
	 <dd> all tags defined in the <code>pia-xhtml</code> tagset.
       </dl>
       (1999-02-02) <br>


  <li> <b>Bug</b>Connect<br>
       When doing a "connect put" cannot specify src="/RHServer/persist.out"
       from an agent.  It throws an exception.  src="persist.out" does not
       throw an exception, but it does fail to write output to file.  The same
       code run using process works fine.  "connect entity" requires 
       "/RHServer/persist.out" when running from an agent.
       (1999-01-26) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> passthrough action for elements. <br>
       Not at all clear how best to do this.  One possibility is lazy
       evaluation of &amp;element;.
       (1998-10-12) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Data structure elements <br>
       &lt;headers&gt;, &lt;url&gt;, etc.  need to convert text content to XML
       format, and need to output as text.
       (1998-12-14) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> list elements as namespaces <br>
       Need to support two things: list tags (e.g. &lt;dl&gt;) as namespaces,
       and entities recognizing them when their value <em>contains</em> a
       namespace or name.  Would be easier if there was a simple way for the
       parser to construct arbitrary classes for elements.
       (1998-12-04) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> force tagset reloading <br>
       Is there a convenient way to force an Agent to reload its tagsets?
       Checking last-modified dates would also work, but it could get slow.
       (1998-12-04) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Persistent namespaces <br>
       There are actually two ways to make a namespace persistent:  make it
       the value of an external entity, and make its bindings be external
       entities.  In the latter case, cons up filenames from the entity
       names with a prefix.
       (1998-11-24) <br>

  <li> <b>Note</b> Tagset for external entity. <br>
       Note that an external entity can go up its parent chain to find its
       tagset.  If not given a context explicitly, it can make its own
       TopProcessor when needed.  Note that external entities do want a
       tagset; it's basically the notation.
       (1998-11-19) <br>
       -- The problem here is that the entity needs to know what TopProcessor
	  to use in order to open files; this needs to be passed at run time.

  <li> <b>Note</b> Tagset should be able to create a Processor. <br>
       They can already create their parser.  There are times when you want a
       different processor type, but in most cases the right thing will happen.
       (1998-11-19) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Resource interface. <br>
       Everything having to do with external resources (entities, connections,
       and status) would be much simpler if we had a Resource interface.
       Something like URLConnection only more versatile.
       (1998-11-18) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Assigning attributes to an entity should make namespace.<br>
       Assigning an actual AttributeList works, but using &lt;set&gt;
       doesn't.  Probably best to fix this in <code>setValue</code>.
       (1998-11-18) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Pipelined &lt;extract&gt; <br>
       Should be possible to stream through a series of processors.  Bind
       &amp;item; to current item; evaluate &amp;selection; lazily as needed.
       (1998-10-21) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> shorthand for booleans in extract. <br>
       equivalent to test but with current item in content.
       (1998-10-21) <br>
 
  <li> <b>Bug</b> Test sorted.  Returns true on an unsorted list.  For example:
	<pre>
Input: &lt;test sorted&gt;bats ants toads&lt;/test&gt; 
Result: 1 
        </pre>
	(1998-10-19)<br>

	<li> <b>Bug</b> Pad only pads on the right (align left).  For example:
<pre>
Input: &lt;pre&gt;&lt;text pad align=center width=80&gt;cat&lt;/text&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
Results: &lt;pre&gt;cat                                                                             &lt;/pre&gt;
</pre>
(1998-11-11)<br>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> Prevent infinite loops.  Here's one way to create one:
	<pre>
&lt;repeat foreach entity=x&gt;a b c d e f g&gt;&lt;repeat&gt;&lt;for&gt;&lt;start&gt;2&lt;/start&gt;&lt;stop&gt;5&lt;/stop&gt;&x;&lt;/for&gt;&lt;/repeat&gt;&lt;/repeat&gt;
        </pre>
	(1998-10-19)<br>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> no namespace for all installed agents. <br>
       Best done by making a specialized Entity that knows it's in a
       NamespaceWrap.  
       (1998-10-12) <br>
       
  <li> <b>Impr</b> Simplify Namespace and Context ops. <br>
       getEntityValue, etc. should be removed from Context; the more general
       operations in Index should be used to give a single point of
       definition. 
       (1998-10-12) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> subst has trouble with matches that get to the end. <br>
       This is a generic problem with the regexp stuff.
       (1998-10-9) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> literal element not properly terminated. <br>
       (1998-10-2) <br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> addMarkup has to insert real markup now. <br>
       ...because Text now converts markup characters to entities.
       (1998-10-2) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Use match to split on regexp. <br>
       &lt;text split match=<em>re</em>&gt; should convert content to a single
       string, then split on the given regexp.  This solves the problem of
       how to make <code>sep</code> consistent between <code>split</code> and
       <code>join</code>.
       (1998-09-15) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Some &lt;extract&gt; subs unimplemented. <br>
       xptr is the only one left.
       (1998-09-08)<br>
       -- this can easily be deferred

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> Passive Entities needed. <br>
       Passive entities (character entities) and some normal entities have to
       be defined in the DTD.  Passive entities untested. 
       (1998-08-13) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Parser work needed. <br>
       Literals, CDATA sections, parent, content models, declaration and PI
       parsing, optionally splitting text into tokens, optional case-munging.
       (1998-08-13) <br>
       -- <code>retainTree</code> implemented 08-27 but untested.
          parent stuff (no error checking) 09-11.  literals 09-18/10-1.

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Attribute definitions. <br>
       Attribute types, implied/fixed/etc., default values, handlers.
       Dispatch table for attrs with handlers.  Lazy evaluation(?) 
       (1998-08-13)

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Text Substitution<p>
       Needs to be done using either &lt;select&gt; or its own &lt;subst&gt;
       element with appropriate sub-elements.
       (1998-08-12)<br>
       -- (1998/08/26) handler written but no sub-elements yet.

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> Tagsets don't hack resource names correctly. <br>
       Need to decide between Class and ClassLoader conventions.  ClassLoader
       requires slashes; Class prepends module name.  Need the prepend, then
       change dots to slashes (probably in <code>org.risource.util.NameUtils</code>).
       (1998-08-12)<br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> Can't <em>use</em> a tagset. <br>
       The &lt;tagset&gt; tag only really works in a tagset definition file.
       (1998-08-11)<br>
       -- Possibly best done using a separate useTagset handler.

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> Handler class hierarchy problems. <br>
       There are two many places where we assume that all real handlers
       inherit from BasicHandler.  Fix one way or the other.
       (1998-08-13)<br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Functional programming tools. <br>
       See <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/tut/functional.html">Python</a>
       (1998-08-05)<br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> PI comments <br>
       Comments of the form <code>&lt;?-- text ?&gt;</code> should be discarded
       by the processor rather than being copied.
       (1998-07-15)<br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> PI and declaration actions <br>
       Need to assign separate actions to PI's and declarations by name.
       As a desirable side effect, this will allow loading tagsets and
       interpreting DTD's.  Strictly speaking the name is the name of an
       application, not of an operation.  PI's may have to be handled <em>even
       when passively copying</em>!
       (1998-07-15)<br>
       <p>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> Node construction <em>must</em> set handler. <br>
       All new nodes have to have their handler set properly; this means
       replacing almost all <code>new ParseTree<em>Whatever</em></code> with
       <code>create<em>Whatever</em></code> operations on the current
       Tagset. Easily enforced by eliminating constructors without handlers.
       (1998-07-10)<br>

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> ProcessedContent doesn't insert controls. <br>
       Neither does its predecessor, InterFormContent.
       (1998-07-08) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Parser should put text in <code>next</code> <br>
       (instead of putting it in <code>nextText</code> and increasing the
       number of tests per token).
       (1998-06-29) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> Ought to have <code>NamedChildList</code> <br>
       for the children of things like <code>EntityTable</code> and
       <code>Tagset</code>.
       (1998-06-29) <br>
       -- Actually it might be best to use a ParseTreeTable as a wrapper.

  <li> <b>Bug:</b> appending to undefined entity fails. <br>
       &lt;set name=foo&gt;&lt;get name=foo&gt;...&lt;/set&gt; leaves
       <code>foo</code> undefined.  There must be an explanation...
       (1998-06-26) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Upgrade <code>handle</code> methods. <br>
       The static <code>handle(<em>element</em>)</code> methods in handler
       subclasses should pick up a static instance if possible, rather than
       just calling <code>new</code>.  (See also ''Impr'' of 1998-06-15.)
       (1998-06-25) <br>

  <li> <b>Hole:</b> <code>ToParseTree</code> should take a tagset <br>
       Tagset is needed to attach actions to constructed nodes.
       (1998-06-22) <br>
       -- probably just needs working shallow copy.

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Tagset should extend EntityTable, or reference one. <br>
       This will make it easier to define entities and tags in the same DTD.
       (1998-06-19) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> PUT_VALUE action code needed <br>
       Get a value for the node and put that.  Needs a corresponding
       <code>putValue(<em>node, context, output</em>)</code> in Action; the
       default should be to copy the node.  Could be used for entity expansion
       in attributes.
       (1998-06-18) <br>

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> Caching for subProcess stack <br>
       ContextStack should have a <code>free</code> link to a free
       sub-processor, to be used instead of allocating one.
       (1998-06-18) <br>
       -- <code>subProcess</code> clears <code>free</code>; caller does
	  <code>p.cleanup()</code> when finished to restore it.

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> <code>Filter</code> parse tree input <br> 
       Filter should  be able to read a serialized parse tree.
       (1998-06-15) <br>
       -- It should do so if the input file ends in ``<code>.xho</code>'' or
          ``<code>.xxo</code>''.
       
  <li> <b>Impr:</b> <code>NamedActiveNode</code> values <br>
       Named nodes should have defined, assigned and default values. Only
       defined value should be the children; it would be used for the
       <em>definition</em> of a name.  Want to be able to share assigned
       values; the NodeList of an assigned value would be a copy (just like we
       presently do for attribute lists, and for the same reason). 

  <li> <b>Impr:</b> <code>ParseTreeElement</code> hasActiveAttributes <br>
       ParseTreeElement should keep information about whether any of its
       attributes contain entities that need to be expanded.  Should be much
       faster, since most don't and it's known at parse time.
       The other possibility is lazy evaluation -- don't even look at them
       until they're needed when converting an attribute's value to a string.
