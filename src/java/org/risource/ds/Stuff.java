/** This is the interface for objects in the PIA that have a combination
 *	of indexed list items and named attributes.  It is designed to 
 *	make conversion of legacy PERL code as painless as possible.<p>
 *
 *	The names of some of the methods, e.g. push and pop, come from
 *	the original PERL implementation of the PIA; they have the
 *	virtue of being short and descriptive.  Access functions are
 *	overloaded (almost all are called <code>at</code>) so as to
 *	avoid polluting the name space; they also follow the PERL
 *	convention of adding a final argument for "set" functions.
 *	Specialized implementations are expected to define typed
 *	<code>item</code> and <code>attr</code> methods.<p>
 *
 *	Unlike the normal Java classes, which throw exceptions on
 *	out-of-bounds conditions, Stuff will either do nothing or return a
 *	null value (like PERL), as appropriate.  <p>
 *
 *	It is expected that some implementations of Stuff will be subclassed
 *	to have type-specific content.  In this case, it is expected that:
 *
 *	<ol>
 *	    <li> The insertion routines <code>push</code>, 
 *		 <code>unshift</code>, <code>at(int, Object)</code> and
 *		 <code>at(String, Object)</code> will perform type
 *		 checking.
 *	    <li> Hence, casting the result of a retrieval should never
 *		 raise an exception.
 *	    <li> Type-specific operations will be defined.  By convention
 *		 these are called <code>attr</code> for the keyed operations
 *		 and <code>itemAt</code> for the indexed ones.  Insertion
 *	 	 should use the <code>super</code> operations to bypass type
 *		 checking.
 *	</ol>
