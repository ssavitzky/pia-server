# Importing from w3c's sources was done as follows:
#

# get http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-DOM-Level-1-19981001/java-binding.zip 
unzip java-binding.zip
cd java			# the file unpacked here.
make clean		# get rid of the .class files
cd org
cvs import -m "Import from w3c" pia/src/java/org W3C REC-DOM-Level-1-19981001

# NOTE: 
#   The original Makefile in the top-level (java) directory is not imported
#   in this process.  It contains nothing of great interest, and would have
#   conflicted with the existing Makefile in pia/src/java.
#
#   The precompiled .class files and generated html documentation were also
#   discarded, since they can easily be rebuilt. 
#
#   New HEADER.html and Makefile files were added that conform to local
#   conventions.
