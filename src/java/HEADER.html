<p> This directory contains the source code for classes and applications
    written in Java (which makes no firm distinction between a library class
    and the top-level class of an application).
<p> 
<dl>
  <dt> <b>Note:</b>
  <dd> This is the root of the Java package tree; it is <em>not</em> the
       <code>java</code> package.  Your <code>$CLASSPATH</code> should contain
       this directory, or alternatively you should execute
       the <code>java</code> command <em>in</em> this directory.
</dl>

<p> On a Unix machine, a simple
<pre>
  make all
</pre>
    in this directory will build all of the <code>.class</code> files.  Each
    subdirectory contains a <code>Makefile</code> that includes one or more
    templates from the <code><a href="makefiles/">makefiles/</a></code>
    subdirectory of this directory.

<p> The Makefiles are known to work on Linux with GNU make and Solaris with
    SUN's make.  It is <em>extremely unlikely</em> that they will work on any
    variety of Windows; they rely on having a working Bourne-like shell,
    ``<code>/</code>'' as a filename separator, and a <code>cd</code> command
    that is not sticky between commands issued in sub-shells.

<p> The simplest thing to do on Windows would be to recursively enumerate
    all <code>.java</code> files under this directory, and turn the list into
    a suitable batch file.  The <em>best</em> thing would be to compute the
    complete dependency graph, and compile the roots.

  <dd> Code from Japanese organizations and companies (i.e. entities in the
       <code>.jp</code> top-level domain.
  <dt> <a href="misc/">misc/</a>
  <dd> Classes developed elsewhere that do not specify a package. 
  <dt> <a href="org/">org/</a>
  <dd> Classes developed by organizations that have chosen to abide by Sun's
       package naming convention. (e.g. <code>org.w3c</code>...).
       <dl>
	 <dt> <a href="org/risource">org/risource</a>
	 <dd> Code from <a href="http://www.RiSource.org/">RiSource.org</a>
	 <dt> <a href="org/w3c">org/w3c</a>
	 <dd> Code from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web
	      Consortium</a>.  This may eventually change to <code>w3</code>,
	      depending on exactly which conventions the Consortium decides to
	      follow.

<h3>Log Files</h3>

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="doc.log">doc.log</a>
  <dd> Log from doing ``<code>make doc</code>''.  Useful for tracking down
       problems with Javadoc comments.
  <dt> <a href="holes.log">holes.log</a>
  <dd> Log of all files that contain code or comments indicating that
       something is missing.  Generated by
       <a href="../app/tools/hole-report">../app/tools/hole-report</a>
  <dt> <a href="lines.log">lines.log</a>
  <dd> Line counts and filenames.  Can be fed to <code>xdu</code> for a
       graphical display.
  <dt> <a href="make.log">make.log</a>
  <dd> Log, preferably from doing
       ``<code>make all JAVAFLAGS=-deprecation</code>''
  <dt> <a href="summary.log">summary.log</a>
  <dd> Counts of holes and <code>.java</code> files; other summary
       information. 
</dl>

All log files can be regenerated with the command
<pre>
  make logs
</pre>

<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>

<p>Every effort has been made to reduce directory depth in order to accomodate
Microsoft and ISO9660 restrictions.  In particular, the hierarchy extends only
three more levels below this directory (e.g. <code>crc/dps/handle</code>).
There is room for one more, so that when/if we achieve `<code>.org</code>'
status we can add that level to the hierarchy.
