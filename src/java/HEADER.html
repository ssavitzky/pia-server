<p> This directory contains the source code for classes and applications
    written in Java (which makes no firm distinction between a library class
    and the top-level class of an application).
<p> 
<dl>
  <dt> <b>Note:</b>
  <dd> This is the root of the Java package tree; it is <em>not</em> the
       <code>java</code> package.  Your <code>$CLASSPATH</code> should contain
       this directory, or alternatively you should execute your
       <code>java</code> and <code>javac</code> commands <em>in</em> this
       directory.  (This is, effectively, what the <code>Makefile</code>s do.)

<h3>Log Files</h3>

  <dd> Sorted list of all Java source files in the tree. 
  <dt> <a href="doc.log">doc.log</a>
  <dd> Log from doing ``<code>make doc</code>''.  Useful for tracking down
       problems with Javadoc comments.
  <dt> <a href="holes.log">holes.log</a>
  <dd> Log of all files that contain code or comments indicating that
       something is missing.  Generated by
       <a href="../app/tools/hole-report">../app/tools/hole-report</a>
  <dt> <a href="lines.log">lines.log</a>
  <dd> Line counts and filenames.  Can be fed to <code>xdu</code> for a
       graphical display.
  <dt> <a href="make.log">make.log</a>
  <dd> Log, preferably from doing
       ``<code>make all JAVAFLAGS=-deprecation</code>''
  <dt> <a href="summary.log">summary.log</a>
  <dd> Counts of holes and <code>.java</code> files; other summary
       information.

All log files can be regenerated with the command
<pre>
  make logs

<h2>Building the PIA</h2>

<p> On a Unix machine, a simple
<pre>
  make all
</pre>
    in this directory will build all of the <code>.class</code> files.  Each
    subdirectory contains a <code>Makefile</code> that includes one or more
    templates from the <code><a href="makefiles/">makefiles/</a></code>
    subdirectory of this directory.

<p> The Makefiles are known to work on Linux with GNU make and Solaris with
    SUN's make.  It is <em>extremely unlikely</em> that they will work on any
    variety of Windows; they rely on having working Bourne-shell control
    structures, ``<code>/</code>'' as a filename separator, and a
    <code>cd</code> command that is not sticky between commands issued in
    sub-shells.

<p> The simplest thing to do on Windows would be to recursively enumerate
    all <code>.java</code> files under this directory, and turn the list into
    a suitable batch file.  The <em>best</em> thing would be to compute the
    complete dependency graph and compile the roots.


<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>

<p>Every effort has been made to reduce directory depth in order to accomodate
Microsoft and ISO9660 restrictions.  In particular, the hierarchy extends only
four more levels below this directory
(e.g. <code>org/risource/dps/handle</code>) in cases where package names are
under our control.  In the case of imports, we take what we can get and hope
that your operating system can cope.

<p>Moreover, every effort has been made to avoid pairs of files that cannot be
distinguished by case-insensitive filesystems.  Note, however, that if
the operating system <em>changes</em> the case in file names when a program
reads a directory, there is still an opportunity for problems (including, but
not limited to, broken links) to occur.

<p>Note that we do <em>not</em> guarantee that class names will be unique when
squashed down to DOS ``8.3'' format.  If your Java development system cannot
cope with this, you're out of luck.  We <em>do</em> recommend that class names
be kept to 15 characters or less, but that's just to prevent unwanted line
wraps and keep multi-column listings under control.
