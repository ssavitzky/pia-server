<p> This directory contains makefile templates for compiling Java classes and
    packages; they are meant to be included using the ``<code>include</code>''
    directive of GNU or similar versions of <code>make</code>.  They are known
    to work on Linux and Solaris with GNU <code>make</code>.  They used to
    work with Sun's <code>make</code>, but this hasn't been tested recently.
</p>

<p> A little attention has been paid to making the makefiles work on Windows,
    but unless <code>make</code>, java, and the shell interpret
    ``<code>/</code>'' as the file separator there is little hope that they
    will really work.  A better solution would be to use an OS-independent
    tool like
    <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html"><code>ant</code></a>.
