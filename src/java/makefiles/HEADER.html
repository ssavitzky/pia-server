<h1>Java Makefiles</h1>  <!-- -*-html-helper-*- -->

<a href="../">[..]</a>
<a href="#files">[files]</a><p>

<p> This directory contains makefile templates; they are meant to be included
    using the ``<code>include</code>'' directive of GNU or similar versions of
    <code>make</code>.  They are known to work on Linux with GNU make and
    Solaris with SUN's make.

<p> A little attention has been paid to making it work on Windows, but unless
    <code>make</code>, java, and the shell interpret ``<code>/</code>'' as the 
    file separator there is little hope that they will really work.
