</p>

<p> This is the top-level directory for source code (other than PIA <a
    href="../Agents">Agents and Applications</a>) generated by members of the
    PIA Project.  This includes, for example, the Java source code for the PIA
    itself, tools and other applications, and so on.
</p>

<p> This directory also includes copies of a small number of software packages
    obtained elsewhere (for example, the Java interfaces of the World Wide Web
    Consortium's <a href="java/org/w3c/dom/">Document Object Model</a>).  We
    believe that we are permitted, under their respective licenses, to
    distribute these packages, and we include a link back to their
    ``official'' homes on the Internet.  Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee
    that the versions included here are the most recent ones. 
</p>

<p>
<em>This directory subtree need not be included in a binary-only software
based on the PIA, provided a link is provided to the location of the sources
on the Web.</em> 
</p>

<p> Note that a C port of the PIA is in progress, and is located at <code><a
    href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cpia/">
    sourceforge.net/projects/cpia/ </a></code>, with a project home page at
    <code><a
    href="http://cpia.sourceforge.net/">cpia.sourceforge.net</a></code>.

<h2>Annotated Contents</h2>

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="app/">app/</a>
  <dd> Separate, stand-alone applications meant to be executed from a command
       line or other shell.  Utilities.
  <dt> <a href="java/">java/</a>
  <dd> Java packages.  (Note that Java does not distinguish between a class
       library and an application, so we can put them all in one place.)
       <dl>
	 <dt> <strong>NOTE:</strong>
	 <dd> The <a href="java/">java/</a> subdirectory does <em>not</em>
	      correspond to the ``<code>java.*</code>'' package -- it is
	      instead the <em>root</em> of the Java language package
	      hierachy.  The simplest thing is to <code>cd</code> to the
	      <a href="java/">java/</a> subdirectory and run programs like
	      <code>javac</code> and <code>javadoc</code> from there.

<h3><a name="make-targets">Typical Make Targets</a></h3>

<p> All software in this distribution is designed to be built using the GNU
    version of the <code>make</code> utility.  It <em>may</em> be possible to
    build it on a DOS-based system provided you have GNU <code>make</code> and
    a totally Bourne-compatible shell such as GNU <code>bash</code>.

<dl>
  <dt> <code>make all</code>
  <dd> Make all binaries.
  <dt> <code>make doc</code>
  <dd> Make documentation (mainly installed in
       <a href="../Doc"><code>../Doc</code></a> and its subdirectories).
  <dt> <code>make install</code>
  <dd> Install executables in <a href="../bin"><code>pia/bin</code></a>,
       and libraries in 
       <a href="../lib"><code>pia/lib</code></a>. 
</dl>

<h2><a name="naming">Naming Conventions</a></h2>

<p> In general, source code sub-directories that correspond to ``packages'' or
    ``modules in object-oriented programming languages like Perl and Java obey
    the naming conventions of those languages.  So, for example, the
    subdirectories of <code>perl</code> (if it existed) would have uppercase
    module names, while the subdirectories of <code>java</code> have lowercase
    package names.
