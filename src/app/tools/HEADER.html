<h1>.../pia/src/app/tools</h1>

<a href="../">[..]</a>

This directory contains a grab-bag of small scripts and other tools that
members of the PIA group have found useful during the development process.  In
some cases it is expected that a script will be sucked into an e-mail message,
edited, and sent to the relevant developers rather than used directly.<p>

Please put a short description in a comment at the front of each script.<p>

The reason for having this directory is so that people don't have to go
rummaging around in their e-mail archives to find out how to fix up a
directory tree after moveing its CVS archive.<p>
