<p>
This directory contains a grab-bag of small scripts and other tools that
members of the PIA group have found useful during the development process.  In
some cases it is expected that a script will be sucked into an e-mail message,
edited, and sent to the relevant developers rather than used directly.
</p>

<p> Please put a short description in a comment at the front of each script.
</p>

<p>
The reason for having this directory is so that people don't have to go
rummaging around in their e-mail archives to find out how to fix up a
directory tree after moveing its CVS archive.
