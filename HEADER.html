<h2>Annotated Contents</h2>

<h3><a name="Documents">Documents</a></h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="README">README</a>
  <dd> 
  <dt> <a href="LICENSE">LICENSE</a>
  <dd> The license under which this software is distributed.
</dl>

<h3><a name="Directories">Directories</a></h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="Agents/">Agents/</a>
  <dd> Agent and application directories.
  <dt> <a href="Config/">Config/</a>
  <dd> Configuration files for various PIA-based appliances, operating
       systems, and so on.
  <dt> <a href="Contrib/">Contrib/</a>
  <dd> Contributed software.
  <dt> <a href="Doc/">Doc/</a>
  <dd> ``pure'' (non-active) documentation, including manuals, how-to guides,
       etc. to be included with the release.
  <dt> <a href="Samples/">Samples/</a>
  <dd> This directory contains sample agents and applications that are
       meant to be copied and extended; they are not particularly useful by
       themselves.
  <dt> <a href="Tagsets/">Tagsets/</a>
  <dd> This directory contains tagsets used in the PIA.  The names of tagsets
       in this directory are normally prefixed with <code>/Tagsets/</code>
       (i.e. they are relative to the top-level SubSite) to allow for user
       customization. 
  <dt> <a href="bin/">bin/</a>
  <dd> Binaries (executable files).  In addition to the PIA, this directory
       includes some additional applications here for use on ``thin'' servers
       and other PIA-based appliances.
  <dt> <a href="lib/">lib/</a>
  <dd> Libraries.  This directory also contains the fundamental tagsets that
       are not expected to be customized.  Tagsets in <code>lib</code> should
       be prefixed with <code>pia:/lib/</code>, i.e. they are found relative
       to <code>$<em>PIA_HOME</em></code>, which is common to all PIA-based
       applications.
  <dt> <a href="src/">src/</a>
  <dd> Source code for the PIA and related utilities.
</dl>

<h3><a name="virtual">Virtual Resources</a></h3>

<p> The following documents and directories are not part of the distribution.
    However, if you are viewing this directory through a PIA in its default
    configuration, they will be present in the listing.  Unless otherwise
    noted, they are actually located in your PIA root directory
    (<code>$HOME/.pia</code> on Unix).
</p>

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="Icon/">Icon/</a>
       (from <a href="Agents/ROOT/">Agents/ROOT/</a> )
  </dt>
  <dd> Icon directory.
       
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="logs/">logs/</a>
  </dt>
  <dd> Where the PIA puts log files.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="robots.txt">robots.txt</a>
       (from <a href="Agents/ROOT/">Agents/ROOT/</a> )
  </dt>
  <dd> Control file that tells robots (web crawlers, search engines) which
       subdirectories to ignore.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="welcome.inc">welcome.inc</a>
  </dt>
  <dd> Not provided by default -- if you create a file with this name in your
       PIA root directory, it will be inserted into your PIA's home page
       between the heading and the documentation grid.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Naming Conventions</h2>

<p> Sub-directories that contain source code, libraries, and executables
    follow the Unix naming convention: <code>src</code>, <code>lib</code>, and
    <code>bin</code> respectively.  Directory names that correspond to
    ``packages'' or ``modules'' in various object-oriented languages follow
    the conventions of those languages, i.e., lowercase for Java modules and
    uppercase for Perl modules.

<p> Subdirectories that contain documents (active or otherwise) utually have
    capitalized filenames: <code>Doc</code>, <code>Agents</code>, etc.
    Directories with names derived from e-mail addresses or site names are
    generally lowercased, e.g., <code>Notes/steve</code> and
    <code>Contrib/rsv.ricoh.com</code>; exceptions are be made for names, such
    as <a href="http://www.RiSource.org/"><code>RiSource.org</code></a>, that
    are capitalized according to local conventions.
