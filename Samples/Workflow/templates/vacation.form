Statement of Understanding: <br />

An employee who has completed their 90 day introductory employment period
may with manager's approval take vacation time in advance of earning the
vacation benefit. The amount of such advance vacation time shall not exceed
the employee's current annual vacation accrual. In the event an employee who
resigns or is terminated has a negative vacation balance (i.e. the employee
has used more vacation time than was accrued through the date of
termination), the amout due the company will be deducted from any monies due
the employee. Should the amount due the company exceed the amount due the
employee, the employee shall refund the excess to the company.
