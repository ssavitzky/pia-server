<h2>Sample Applications</h2>

<p> This directory contains a subdirectory for each sample application that
    is meant to be accessible at the top level of a PIA server, i.e. as
    <code>~<em>name</em></code>.  Many of these top-level applications consist
    of an Agent and the pages that control and describe it.
</p>

<p> This directory is ``overlaid'' by your personal Samples directory; this
    lets you make private versions of any agent's files.  Your personal Samples
    directory is normally located under <code>$PIA_HOME</code>; which is
    typically <code>~/.pia</code> on a Unix system.  The last line in the
    directory listing (<a href="#paths">below</a>) will give its actual
    location in this server. 
</p>

<h2>Applications</h2>

<p> The following directories contain ``web applications'' that may, in some
    cases, be made available as ``home directories'' just like agents.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="Browser/">Browser</a>
  </dt>
  <dd> Browser-specific samples.  This may, for example, include pages that
       add a sidebar to Netscape6-based browsers.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="ExtensionDemo/">ExtensionDemo</a>
  </dt>
  <dd> Illustrates how to associate a tagset with a filename extension.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="FileHandling/">FileHandling</a>
  </dt>
  <dd> 
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="Form/">Form</a>
  </dt>
  <dd> An exceedingly simple form.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="HelloWorld/">HelloWorld</a>
  </dt>
  <dd> An absolutely trivial application.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="LiquidDoc/">LiquidDoc</a>
  </dt>
  <dd> An example of a ``liquid document'' -- one in which links that
       correspond to details are expanded in place. 
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="PrettyStuff/">PrettyStuff</a>
  </dt>
  <dd> A pretty, albeit useless, application home page that uses the PIA's
       standard page-layout tags. 
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="TagsetDemo/">TagsetDemo</a>
  </dt>
  <dd> Similar to <a href="HelloWorld/">HelloWorld</a> but with its own local
       tagset. 
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="Ticker/">Ticker</a>
  </dt>
  <dd> A ``stock ticker'' that contains an Agent that grabs a stock price from
       a remote website every so often.
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="Workflow/">Workflow</a>
  </dt>
  <dd> The bones of a forms server for a small office.  By no means complete
       out-of-the-box, but it is intended to be customized into a small-office
       intranet application that can (we hope!) be maintained by HTML-savvy
       non-programmers.
