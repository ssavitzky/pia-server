<h1>PIA Initialization file</h1>

<p> Note that all we have to do is stat the directories in order to initialize
    their agents.  Running this again will have no effect, because they will
    already have been initialized.

<define element="init-children">
  <doc> Descend into the children of a directory and force each to initialize
	itself.  Naturally we only do this for directories believed to contain
	agents.

<!-- Due to a bug, init-children doesn't seem to work recursively yet.
     That's ok, though; we just load an initialize.inc file where necessary.
