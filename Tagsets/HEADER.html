<h1>Tagsets</h1>
<a href="../">[..]</a>
<a href="#files">[files]</a><p>

<p> This directory contains the tagsets which the designer of a PIA-based
    application is likely to need to customize. 

<dl>
  <dt> <b>Note:</b>
  <dd> <a href="../lib/"><code>../lib/</code></a> contains the tagsets that
       are essential to the functioning of the PIA.  You are encouraged to
       look at them, of course, but it is unlikely that anything in that
       directory will need to be changed.
  <dt> <b>Naming:</b>
  <dd> The names of tagsets in this directory are normally prefixed with
       <code>/Tagsets/</code> (i.e. they are relative to the top-level
       SubSite) to allow for user customization.
