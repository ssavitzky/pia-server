<h1>.../pia/Contrib</h1>

This directory is for software, especially configuration files, contributed by
PIA users and developers. <p>

<em>The contents of this directory are not an official part of the PIA
distribution, but are included in the hope that they will make it more
useful.</em><p>

Each directory in this subtree corresponds to a site, and each directory under
that to a user.  Under each user, the ``<code>my/</code>'' subdirectory
contains the contents of the that user's PIA state directory
(``<code>~/.pia/</code>'' on Unix systems) -- the name is changed to avoid
having special characters in the names.  Other configuration files, if the
user chooses to put them here, are <em>not</em> renamed. <p>

  <dd>  This is a working example of a forms processing system.  It will
	eventually move outside the PIA directory since it contains
	information very specific to RSV. At that time, an abstracted version
	will be created and place in the proper location of this hierarchy.
