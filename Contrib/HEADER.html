<p> This directory is for software, especially configuration files,
    contributed by PIA users and developers.
</p>

<p> <em>The contents of this directory are not an official part of the PIA
    distribution, but are included in the hope that they will make it more
    useful.</em>
</p>

<p>Each directory in this subtree corresponds to a site, and each directory
under that to a user, project, or product.  Under each user, the
``<code>my/</code>'' subdirectory contains the contents of the that user's PIA
user directory (``<code>~/.pia/</code>'' on Unix systems) -- the name is
changed to avoid having special characters in the names.  Other configuration
files, if the user chooses to put them here, <em>not necessarily</em> renamed.

  <dt>  <a href="Forms">RSV forms agent</a>
  <dd> At one point this was a working example of a forms processing system.
       It is nowoutside the PIA directory since it contains information very
       specific to RSV, and also relies on an older (pre-XML) form of the
       PIA's tag language.  At some point an abstracted version will be
       created and place in the proper location of this hierarchy.
