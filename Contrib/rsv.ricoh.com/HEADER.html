This directory is for software, especially configuration files, contributed by
PIA users and developers at Ricoh Silicon Valley, &lt;<a
href="http://rsv.ricoh.com/">rsv.ricoh.com</a>&gt; (including the Ricoh
California Research Center, &lt;<a
href="http://www.crc.ricoh.com/">crc.ricoh.com</a>&gt;). <p>

<em>The contents of this directory are not an official part of the PIA
distribution, but are included in the hope that they will make it more
useful.</em><p>

Each directory in this subtree corresponds to a user.  Under each user, the
``<code>my/</code>'' subdirectory contains the contents of the that user's PIA
state directory (``<code>~/.pia/</code>'' on Unix systems) -- the name is
changed to avoid having special characters in the names.  Other configuration
files, if the user chooses to put them here, are <em>not</em> renamed. <p>
