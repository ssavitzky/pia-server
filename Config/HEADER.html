       of the PIA server's ``website'' (URL hierarchy).
  <li> <a href="#env">Environment</a> configurations, for various operating
       systems and environments. 
  <li> The ``<a href="#sdk">Software Development Kit</a>'', consisting of

<h2>Annotated Contents</h2>

<h3><a name="pia">PIA Configuration Files</a></h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="proxy.xcf"><code>proxy.xcf</code></a>
  <dd> This is a <em>sample</em> configuration file designed to be included in
       a PIA that is accessed through a proxy such as Apache.  It is unlikely
       to work unmodified in your environment. 
</dl>

<h3><a name="site">Site Configuration Files</a></h3>

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="Site/">Site/</a>
  <dd> This subdirectory contains sample site configuration files, and include
       files used in site and subsite configurations.
</dl>

<h3><a name="env">Operating Systems &amp; Environments</a></h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="Servlet/">Servlet/</a>
  </dt>
  <dd> Configuration files for use with the Java Servlet implementation
       classes PIAServlet and DPSServlet. 
  </dd>
  <dt> <a href="unix/">unix/</a>
  <dd> Configuration files for Unix or Linux users.  Currently contains an
       Apache configuration file that can be used to invisibly proxy requests
       to a PIA.  This is an easy way to make a PIA server visible on port 80,
       which is normally a priviledged port that only processes owned by the
       superuser can listen on.
</dl>

<h3><a name="sdk">Software Development Kit</a></h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="makefiles/">makefiles/</a>
  <dd> Templates to be included in Makefile's.
