<h1>Guide to PIA Agents</h1>
</center>

<p>This document describes the sample agents and applications that ship with
the PIA. PIA agents fall into three categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#Standard">Standard agents</a> that are automatically
installed when the PIA is set up.</li>

<li><a href="#Optional">Optional agents/applications</a> that ship with
the PIA and can be installed at the user's discretion.</li>

<li><a href="#Contributed">Contributed agents</a> made available by
the PIA developer community.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2><a name="Standard">Standard Agents</a></h2>

<p>The agents currently available are:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="#Admin">Admin</a></li>
  <li> <a href="#Proxie">Proxie</a></li>
       <ul>
	 <li> <a href="#Toolbar">Toolbar</a>
	 <li> <a href="#History">History</a></li>
	 <li> <a href="#Cache">Cache</a> (presently unimplemented)</li>
       </ul>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Admin">Admin</a></h3>

<p> The Admin agent is the ``server administration'' or ``control panel''
    agent.  It manages all the other agents that make up the PIA Agency.
    Because Admin is potentially dangerous, the default configuration protects
    it with the Unix password file, if there is one. 
</p>

<h3><a name="Proxie">The Proxie Agents</a></h3>

<p> Proxie is the main agent in a group of related agents that operate when
    the PIA is used as a proxy for web browsing.   The Proxie family of agents
    combine to make the PIA a powerful ``web browser's assistant,'' which was
    the original goal when the PIA was designed.
</p>

<p> To use these agents, set your browsers to use your PIA (sometimes referred
    to as your Personal Information Agency when it's being used in this way)
    as your proxy.  This setting is usually found under the Network options
    available under edit/preferences, options/network, or some similar
    menu. You need to specify both the host name and port--8888 by default--
    where your agency is running.
</p>

<h4><a name="Toolbar">Toolbar</a></h4>

<p> The Toolbar agent is the ``type'' agent for agents that put a ``toolbar''
    of links at the top of a page.  
</p>

<p> There are two Toolbar agents. The <code>fileTools</code> agent adds a
    toolbar to pages served from local files by DOFS agents in the PIA
    agency. The remoteTools agent adds a toolbar to remote pages proxied
    through your agency.
</p>

<p> The <code>remoteTools</code> agent is also the agent responsible for
    displaying the URL of every HTML page you visit as the output of the
    <code>pia</code> command.
</p>

<h4><a name="History">History Agent</a></h4>

<p> The History agent tracks all web pages that you visit from any
    browser, allowing you to search those URLs by date.

<p> Once you set your Information Agency as your proxy, browse to a few
    external web pages, then visit the <a href="/History/home.xh"> History
    agent's home page</a>. You should see a link to today's date
    (e.g. <tt>[Hist: / 1998 / 08 / 04]</tt>) The last component, the day, is
    a list of links to all the pages you visited on that day.  The month and
    year are directories corresponding to that month and year.
</p>

<h4><a name="Cache">Cache Agent</a></h4>

<blockquote><em>
  (The Cache agent may not be functional in versions of the PIA prior to
  release 2.1; it's still experimental.)
</em></blockquote>

<p> Unlike the History agent, which saves only URL's, the Cache agent saves
    <em>entire pages</em>.  This can take up a lot of space, but it can speed
    things up if you go back to a page you've visited recently.  Eventually we
    want to be able to display the differences if a page has changed since the
    last time you visited it.

<h2><a name="Optional">Optional Applications</a></h2>

<p> The following applications, some of which include agents, are started
    automatically when you visit their ``home directories'' under
    <code>/Agents/</code>:</p> 

<ul>
  <li>SimpleCalendar </li>
  <li>View</li>
  <li>Tutorial</li>
  <li>Demo</li>
</ul>

<h3>SimpleCalendar</h3>

<p> The SimpleCalendar agent is a simple appointment calendar with day, month,
    and year views, storing both one-time and repeating events as XML files
    in a simple directory tree.
</p>

<h3>View</h3>

<p>The View agent lets you view documents after those document are processed
with a tagset or script.  Three of the ``views'' provided are as raw text, as a
``slide'' presentation, and as the documentation for a ``tagset''.</p>

<h3>Tutorial</h3>

<p> The Tutorial agent gives you an interactive tutorial in the PIA's tag
    language; it is also available <a
    href="http://pia.rsv.ricoh.com/Tutorial/home.xh">online</a>.
</p>

<h3>Demo</h3>

<p>This agent serves as both a demonstration and testbed for the PIA's
executable tag markup language and its formatter/interpreter. Its home page
provides links to pages that show examples of tag usage.  It is more like a
reference manual than a tutorial.</p>

<h2>Contributed Agents</h2>

<p>Agents <a name="Contributed">contributed</a> by the PIA
developer community can be found in the directory <code>
Contrib/&lt;host.name&gt;/Agents</code> Install these agents much
as you would any of the optional agents provided by Ricoh.</p>

<p>Users can place a copy of their agent directories in <code>
/Contrib/<em>host.name</em>/</code> and submit them to the PIA group for
inclusion in the general release. </p>
