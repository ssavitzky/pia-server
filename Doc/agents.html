<h1>Guide to PIA Agents</h1>
</center>

<p>This document describes the sample agents that ship with the
PIA. PIA agents fall into three categories:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#Standard">Standard agents</a> that are automatically
installed when the PIA is set up.</li>

<li><a href="#Optional">Optional agents</a> that ship with
the PIA and can be installed at the user's discretion.</li>

<li><a href="#Contributed">Contributed agents</a> made available by
the PIA developer community.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2><a name="Standard">Standard Agents</a></h2>

<p>The agents currently available are:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="#ROOT">ROOT</a>
  <li><a href="#Admin">Admin</a></li>
  <li> <a href="#DOFS">DOFS</a>
     <ul>
       <li> <a href="#Doc">Doc</a>
       <li><a href="#PIA">PIA</a></li>
     </ul>
  <li><a href="#Proxie">Proxie</a></li>
       <ul>

	 <li> <a href="#History">History</a></li>
	 <li> <a href="#Cache">Cache</a></li>
       </ul>
</ul>

<h3><a name="ROOT">ROOT</h3>

<p> The ROOT agent is the main agent: it serves pages from the root directory
    of the URL directory tree.  It is also responsible for directing requests
    to the appropriate agents (any URL that doesn't start with the name of an
    agent must be for ROOT).
</p>

<p> Like all agents, the ROOT agent has a data directory that appears as a
    ``virtual subdirectory'' called ``<code>~/</code>''.  Since the ROOT
    agent's URL is ``<code>/</code>'', its data directory is addressed by the
    URL ``<code>/~/</code>''.  The ROOT agent's data directory is the PIA's
    ``user-data directory,'' usually referred to as
    <code><em>USER_DIR</em></code> because that is the name of the environment
    variable that points to it.  On Unix systems, the default user directory
    is <code>.pia</code> in your home directory.


<h3><a name="Admin">Admin</a></h3>

<p> The Admin agent is the ``server administration'' or ``control panel''
    agent.  It manages all the other agents that make up the PIA Agency.</p>

<h3><a name="DOFS">DOFS</a></h3>

<p> The DOFS (Document-Oriented File System) agent is the ``type'' (generic)
    agent for the specialized agents that serve local files.  Requests
    starting with the name of a DOFS agent are served by appending the
    remainder of the URL to the ``root'' directory of the DOFS agent. 

<h4><a name="Doc">Doc</a></h4>

<p> Doc is the most important DOFS agent, and is one of two that are started
    by default: its ``root'' directory is <code><em>PIA_HOME</em>/Doc</code>,
    the PIA's top-level documentation directory.

<h4><a name="PIA">PIA</a></h4>

<p> PIA is the other standard DOFS agent; its root directory is
    <code><em>PIA_HOME</em></code>, the directory the PIA is installed in.  On
    most Unix systems this will be a subdirectory of your home directory,
    especially if you are doing software development on the PIA.  At sites
    where many users are using the PIA but not doing much development, this
    may be a shared directory.  On a special-purpose ``appliance'', the PIA's
    files are typically in the home directory of a ``user'' with the login
    name ``<code>pia</code>''.

<p> One may well ask why <code>Doc</code> and <code>PIA</code> are separate
    agents, since the documentation is also accessible as
    <code>/PIA/Doc</code>.  The answer is that it may be desirable to limit
    access to the main PIA directory, or to move the documentation (which is
    bulky) to a directory -- or even a separate web server -- that all users
    can share. 

<h3><a name="Proxie">The Proxie Agents</a></h3>

<p> Proxie is the main agent in a group of related agents that operate when
    the PIA is used as a proxy for web browsing.   The Proxie family of agents
    combine to make the PIA a powerful ``web browser's assistant,'' which was
    the original goal when the PIA was designed.

<p> To use these agents, set your browsers to use your PIA (sometimes referred
    to as your Personal Information Agency when it's being used in this way)
    as your proxy.  This setting is usually found under the Network options
    available under edit/preferences, options/network, or some similar
    menu. You need to specify both the host name and port--8888 by default--
    where your agency is running.

<h4><a name="Toolbar">Toolbar</a></h4>

<p> The Toolbar agent is the ``type'' agent for agents that put a ``toolbar''
    of links at the top of a page.  

<p> There are two Toolbar agents. The fileTools agent adds a toolbar to pages
    served from local files by DOFS agents in the PIA agency. The remoteTools
    agent adds a toolbar to remote pages proxied through your agency.

<p> The <code>remoteTools</code> agent is also the agent responsible for
    displaying the URL of every HTML page you visit as the output of the
    <code>pia</code> command.

<h4><a name="History">History Agent</a></h4>

<p> The History agent tracks all web pages that you visit from any
browser, allowing you to search those URLs by date.

<p> Once you set your Information Agency as your proxy, browse to a few
    external web pages, then visit the <a href="/History/home.xh"> History
    agent's home page</a>. You should see a link to today's date
    (e.g. <tt>[Hist: / 1998 / 08 / 04]</tt>) The last component, the day, is
    a list of links to all the pages you visited on that day.  The month and
    year are directories corresponding to that month and year.
</p>

<h4><a name="Cache">Cache Agent</a></h4>

<blockquote><em>
  (The Cache agent may not be functional in versions of the PIA prior to
  release 2.1; it's still experimental.)
</em></blockquote>

<p> Unlike the History agent, which saves only URL's, the Cache agent saves
    <em>entire pages</em>.  This can take up a lot of space, but it can speed
    things up if you go back to a page you've visited recently.  Eventually we
    want to be able to display the differences if a page has changed since the
    last time you visited it.

<h2><a name="Optional">Optional Agents</a></h2>

<p>The PIA provides a simple form for installing agents. Look for it in
<code>Admin/install_agent</code>. The optional
agents currently shipping with the PIA include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Swifty</li>
  <li>HelloWorld</li>
  <li>View</li>
  <li>Demo</li>
</ul>

<h3>Swifty</h3>

<p>The Swifty agent lets you  easily customize your PIA home
page. It offers the option of adding useful links, provides a
custom page title and a decorative image.</p>

<h3>HelloWorld</h3>

<p>The HelloWorld agent lets you choose a custom
greeting.  This agent provides a simple example of form use for PIA
developers.</p>

<h3>View</h3>

<p>The View agent lets you view documents after those document are processed
with a tagset or script.  Three of the ``views'' provided are as raw text, as a
``slide'' presentation, and as the documentation for a ``tagset''.</p>

<h3>Demo</h3>

<p>This agent serves as both a demonstration and testbed for the PIA's
extended HTML markup language and its formatter/interpreter. Its home page
provides links to pages that show examples of tag usage.</p>

<h2>Contributed Agents</h2>

<p>Agents <a name="Contributed">contributed</a> by the PIA
developer community can be found in the directory <code>
Contrib/&lt;host.name&gt;/Agents</code> Install these agents much
as you would any of the optional agents provided by Ricoh.</p>

<p>Users can place a copy of their agent directories in <code>
Contrib/<em>HOST.NAME</em>/</code> and submit them to the PIA group for
inclusion in the general release. Before attempting to install a
contributed agent, copy its directory and files to <code><var>
PIA_ROOT</var>/Agents</code> or <code><var>
PIA_HOME</var>/Agents</code>.</p>
