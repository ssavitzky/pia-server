<h1>Guide to PIA Applications</h1>
</center>

<p>This document describes the sample applications that ship with
the PIA.  PIA applications fall into three basic categories:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="#Standard">Standard applications</a> that are part of the PIA
       distribution and are automatically started when the PIA is run in its
       default configuration.</li>

  <li> <a href="#Contributed">Contributed applications</a> made available by
       the PIA developer community.</li>

  <li> <a href="#Private">Private applications</a> that an organization
       develops for its own use.</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<h2><a name="Standard">Standard Applications</a></h2>

<p>The applications currently available are:</p>

<ul>
  <li> <a href="#Admin">Admin</a></li>
  <li> <a href="#Proxie">Proxie</a></li>
       <ul>
	 <li> <a href="#Toolbar">Toolbar</a>
	 <li> <a href="#History">History</a></li>
	 <li> <a href="#Cache">Cache</a> (presently unimplemented)</li>
       </ul>
  <li> <a href="#SimpleCalendar">SimpleCalendar</a>
  <li> <a href="#View">View</a>
  <li> <a href="#Tutorial">Tutorial</a>
  <li> <a href="#Demo">Demo</a>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Admin">Admin</a></h3>

<p> The Admin application is the ``server administration'' or ``control
    panel'' application.  It manages all the other applications that make up
    the PIA Agency.  Because Admin is potentially dangerous, the default
    configuration protects it with the Unix password file, if there is one.
</p>

<h3><a name="Proxie">The Proxie Applications</a></h3>

<p> Proxie is the main application in a group of related applications that
    operate when the PIA is used as a proxy for web browsing.  The Proxie
    family of applications combine to make the PIA a powerful ``web browser's
    assistant,'' which was the original goal when the PIA was designed.
</p>

<p> To use these applications, set your browsers to use your PIA (sometimes
    referred to as your Personal Information Agency when it's being used in
    this way) as your proxy.  This setting is usually found under the Network
    options available under edit/preferences, options/network, or some similar
    menu. You need to specify both the host name and port--8888 by default--
    where your agency is running.
</p>

<p> All of the Proxie applications are ``<em>agents</em>'' -- they contain
    pieces of XML code that ``look over your shoulder'' and operate on HTTP
    requests and responses as they pass through the PIA.
</p>

<h4><a name="Toolbar">Toolbar</a></h4>

<p> There are two Toolbar applications. The <code>fileTools</code> agent adds a
    toolbar to pages served from local files by DOFS applications in the PIA
    agency. The remoteTools application adds a toolbar to remote pages proxied
    through your agency.
</p>

<p> The <code>remoteTools</code> agent is also the agent responsible for
    displaying the URL of every HTML page you visit as the output of the
    <code>pia</code> command.
</p>

<h4><a name="History">History Agent</a></h4>

<p> The History agent tracks all web pages that you visit from any
    browser, allowing you to search those URLs by date.

<p> Once you set your Information Agency as your proxy, browse to a few
    external web pages, then visit the <a href="/History/home.xh"> History
    agent's home page</a>. You should see a link to today's date
    (e.g. <tt>[Hist: / 1998 / 08 / 04]</tt>) The last component, the day, is
    a list of links to all the pages you visited on that day.  The month and
    year are directories corresponding to that month and year.
</p>

<h4><a name="Cache">Cache Agent</a></h4>

<blockquote><em>
  (The Cache agent may not be functional in versions of the PIA prior to
  release 2.1; it's still experimental.)
</em></blockquote>

<p> Unlike the History agent, which saves only URL's, the Cache agent saves
    <em>entire pages</em>.  This can take up a lot of space, but it can speed
    things up if you go back to a page you've visited recently.  Eventually we
    want to be able to display the differences if a page has changed since the
    last time you visited it.


<h3><a name="SimpleCalendar">SimpleCalendar</a></h3>

<p> The SimpleCalendar application is a simple appointment calendar with day,
    month, and year views, storing both one-time and repeating events as XML
    files in a simple directory tree.
</p>

<h3><a name="View">View</a></h3>

<p>The View application lets you view documents after those document are
processed with a tagset or script.  Three of the ``views'' provided are as raw
text, as a ``slide'' presentation, and as the documentation for a
``tagset''.</p>

<h3><a name="Tutorial">Tutorial</a></h3>

<p> The Tutorial application gives you an interactive tutorial in the PIA's
    XML-based document-processing language; it is also available from the <a
    href="http://pia.rsv.ricoh.com/Tutorial/home.xh">PIA demonstration
    server</a>. 
</p>

<h3><a name="Demo">Demo</a></h3>

<p>This application serves as both a demonstration and testbed for the PIA's
executable tag markup language and its formatter/interpreter. Its home page
provides links to pages that show examples of tag usage.  It is more like a
reference manual than a tutorial.</p>

<h2><a name="Contributed">Contributed Applications</a></h2>

<p> The <a href="../Contrib/"><code>PIA/Contrib</code></a> directory is
    intended for applications, documentation, and tools contributed by members
    of the PIA developer community.
</p>

<p> These are the applications we expect <em>you</em> and information
    developers like you to develop.
</p>

<h2><a name="Private">Private Applications</a></h2>

<p> Note that the PIA's <a href="../LICENSE">license</a> allows you
    to build your own private applications using the PIA; you don't have to
    contribute them back to the community if you don't want to (although we
    would prefer it if you did).  This is because the PIA's applications are
    considered documents rather than source code.
