<body><center><h1>Guide to PIA Agents</h1></center><p>This document
describes the sample agents that ship with the PIA. PIA agents fall
into three categories:</p><ul><li><a href = "#Standard">Standard
agents</a> that are automatically installed when the PIA is set
up. </li>
<li><a href = "#OptionalAgents">Optional agents </a>that ship with
the PIA and can be installed at the user's discretion.</li>
<li><a href = "#Contributed">Contributed agents </a>made available
by the PIA developer community.</li></ul><hr><h2><a name = "Standard">Standard
Agents</a></h2><p>The agents currently available are:</p><ul><li><a
    href = "#Admin">Admin</a></li>
<li><a href = "#PIA">PIA and ROOT</a></li>
<li><a href = "#fbi">Toolbar</a></li>
<li><a href = "#History">History</a></li></ul><h3><a name = "Admin"></a>Admin</h3><p>The
Admin agent is the main agent. It manages all the other agents that
make up the PIA Agency.</p><h3><a name = "PIA"></a>PIA and ROOT</h3><p>These
two agents serve the files that are in the <code><var>PIA_DIR</var></code> and
the <code><var>PIA_HOME</var></code> directories respectively. The
PIA and ROOT agents are of type Document-Oriented File System (DOFS).</p><h3><a
    name = "fbi"></a>The Toolbar Agents</h3><p>There are two Toolbar
agents. The localfile agent adds a control menu to pages proxied
by the PIA agency.</p><p>The remote agent adds a control menu to
pages proxied through your agency</p><h3><a name = "History"></a>History
Agent</h3><p>The History agent tracks all web pages that you visit
from any browser, allowing you to search those URLs by date. To
make best use of the History agent, set your browsers to use your
local Information Agency as your proxy (this setting is usually
found under the Network options available under edit/preferences,
options/network, or some similar menu. You need to specify both
the host name and port--8888 by default-- where your agency is running.) </p><p>Once
you set your Information Agency as your proxy, browse to a few external
web pages, then visit the <a href = "/History/home.xh">History agent's
home page</a>. You should see a link to today's date (e.g. <tt>My/History /
1997 / 08 /04</tt>) When you jump to this link you will see a list
of the pages you visited.</p>

<h2>Optional Agents</h2>
<p>The PIA
provides a simple form for installing agents. Look for it in <code>Admin/install_agent</code>.
The <a name=OptionalAgents>optional agents</a> currently shipping with the PIA include:</p><ul>
<li>Swifty</li>
<li>HelloWorld</li>
<li>View</li>
<li>demo</li></ul><h3>Swifty</h3><p>The Swifty agent allows you
to easily customize your PIA home page. It offers the option of
adding useful links, provides a custom page title and a decorative
image</p><h3>HelloWorld</h3><p>The HelloWorld agent allows the user
to choose a custom greeting. This agent provides a simple example
of form use for PIA developers.</p><h3>View</h3><p>The View agent
allows you to view documents after those document are processed
with a tagset or script.</p><h3>demo</h3><p>This agent serves as
both a demonstration and testbed for the PIA's interform markup
language and its formatter/interpreter. Its home page provides links
to tag use examples.</p>

<h2>Contributed Agents</h2>
<p>
Agents <a name=Contributed>contributed</a>
by the PIA developer community can be found in the directory <code>Contrib/&#60;host.name>/Agents</code> Install
these agents much as you would any of the optional agents provided
by Ricoh. </p><p>Users can place a copy of their agent directories
in <code>Contrib/HOST.NAME/</code> and submit them to the PIA group
for inclusion in the general release.  Before attempting to install
a contributed agent,  copy its directory and files to  <code><var>USR_DIR</var>/Agents</code> or<code> <var>PIA_DIR</var>/Agents</code>.</p><p><b>Copyright
