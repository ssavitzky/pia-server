<blockquote><em>
  <strong>You</strong>, the developer community, are the people who are going
  to make the PIA a versatile and vibrant platform for web applications.  Get
  your name in lights, right here.

  <dt> Debra Herman
  <dd> Translated all of the PIA's manuals from Technese into English.
       
  <dt> <a href="http://theStarport.org/suites/Starport/Family/Dad/">Abraham
       Savitzky</a> 
  <dd> Steve Savitzky would like to acknowledge the contribution of his late
       father, the original author of the Julian Day code in
       <code>org.risource.util.Julian</code>, which Steve translated (by way of
       C) from the original FORTRAN.

<h2><a name="core">Core Group</a></h2>

<blockquote><em>
  Currently all of these people are working at <a
  href="http://rsv.ricoh.com">Ricoh Silicon Valley</a>.

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="http://www.crc.ricoh.com/~wolff/">Greg Wolff</a> 
  <dd> Manager of the PIA group (where he can do the least harm) and one of the
       originators of the PIA concept.

  <dt> <a href="http://www.rsv.ricoh.com/~steve/">Steve Savitzky</a>
       &lt;<a href="mailto:steve@rsv.ricoh.com">steve@rsv.ricoh.com</a>&gt;
  <dd> Chief Software Scientist at <a href="http://wwww.rsv.ricoh.com/">Ricoh
       Silicon Valley</a>.  Another originator of the PIA concept, Steve is
       the main architect of the PIA technology.  His research interests
       include hypertext, object-oriented frameworks, and document-oriented
       computing; he has been <strike>playing</strike> working with computers
       for over 30 years.

  <dt> <a href="http://www.rsv.ricoh.com/~bill/">Bill Softky</a>
  <dd> Senior Research Scientist. Bill's task is to make the PIA even more
       "user-friendly" through demos and new applications.  His other research
       interests include unsupervised learning systems, algorithmic signal
       processing, and visual representation of complex information structures
       He has been  playing with computers for 30 years.

<h2><a name="former">Former Core Group Members</a></h2>

<blockquote><em>
  These people are former members of the core group.  They have moved on to
  other projects, but their code lives on and their contributions are deeply
  appreciated. 
</em></blockquote>

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="http://www.rsv.ricoh.com/~pgage/">Pamela Gage</a>
  <dd> ... worked on the <code>&lt;text&gt;</code> tag and wrote the <a
       href="../Agents/Demo/">Demo</a> application, but her biggest
       contribution was probably the PIA's release process, as described in
       <a href="Notes/pgage/build_release.html">her notes</a>.

  <dt> Rithy Roth
  <dd> ... is no longer at Ricoh Silicon Valley; he wrote the earliest version
       of the web server engine, and his code is still the basis for 
       <code>org.risource.content</code>, as well as many parts of
       <code>org.risource.pia</code>, including the <code>Acceptor</code>
       class.  

  <dt> Marko Balabanovic
  <dd> Research scientist.  When he was at RSV, Marko's research was in the
       area of human-computer interaction; interests include multimedia
       authoring and communication, storytelling and narrative, digital
       photography and information appliances.
