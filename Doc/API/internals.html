<h2><a name="implementation">Implementation</a></h2>

The PIA is implemented in Java.  Complete documentation of the Java 
<a href="javadoc/packages.html">packages</a> and 
<a href="javadoc/tree.html">classes</a> can be found in the
<a href="javadoc/">javadoc</a> subdirectory of this Manual.  This
documentation also includes the JavaDoc descriptions of the standard Java
packages used by the PIA.
<p>

There are two classes with useable main programs (several others have main
programs for test purposes):
<ol>
  <li> <a href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.Pia.html">org.risource.pia.Pia</a><br>
       the main program of the PIA itself.
  <li> <a href="javadoc/org.risource.dps.Filter.html">org.risource.dps.Filter</a><br>
       a stand-alone document processor for use as a
       stream filter, document processor, or CGI script.  This replaces the
       earlier interpretor,
</ol>

Both are accessible via small wrapper programs in the <code><a
href="../../../bin">pia/bin</a></code> directory:

<ol>
  <li> <a href="../../../bin/pia"><code>bin/pia</code></a> (and
       <code>pia.exe</code> for Windows)
  <li> <a href="../../../bin/process"><code>bin/process</code></a> (and
       <code>process.exe</code> for Windows)
</ol>

Note that all are stand-alone applications.  None of these programs can be
used inside a browser as applets; since the PIA is basically a server, an
applet would not be particularly useful.<p>

<h3>Packages</h3>

The PIA is implemented using the following packages:

<dl>
  <dt> <a href="javadoc/Package-org.risource.ds.html">org.risource.ds</a>
  <dd> generic <em>Data Structures</em>.  Some were originally written with an
       interface that makes it easy to translate similar constructs in PERL.
       In particular, most return <code>null</code> on out-of-range keys or
       indices instead of throwing an exception.
  <dt> <a href="javadoc/Package-JP.ac.osaka_u.ender.util.regex.html">JP.ac.osaka_u.ender.util.regex</a>
  <dd> A <em>regular-expression</em> package.  Copyright (C) 1997 Shugo Maeda
       under the GNU General Public License.
  <dt> <a href="javadoc/Package-org.risource.dom.html">org.risource.dom</a>
  <dd> The Document Object Model.  This is an implementation of the
       <a href="http://www.w3c.org/">W3C</a>'s DOM draft specification.  While
       the interfaces should be up to date with the 1.0 spec, the
       current implementation has a few differences (related to efficiently
       handling collections of nodes).
  <dt> <a href="javadoc/Package-org.risource.dps.html">org.risource.dps</a>
  <dd> The Document Processing System, which is used for processing executable
       markup.  It uses interfaces in <a
       href="javadoc/Package-org.risource.dom.html">org.risource.dom</a>  for representing
       active parse trees; these are extended to include syntax and semantic
       handlers. 
  <dt> <a href="javadoc/Package-org.risource.dps.handle.html">org.risource.dps.handle</a>
  <dd> Classes that <em>handle</em> particular active elements. 
  <dt> <a href="javadoc/org.risource.dps.Tagset.html">org.risource.dps.Tagset</a>
  <dd> Classes and tagset definition files that implement the various tagsets.
  <dt> <a href="javadoc/Package-org.risource.pia.html">org.risource.pia</a>
  <dd> The <em>PIA</em> itself, and in general everything that deals with HTTP
       <a href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.Transaction.html">Transaction</a>s.
  <dt> <a href="javadoc/Package-org.risource.pia.agent.html">org.risource.pia.agent</a>
  <dd> ``Handle'' classes that implement individual <a
       href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.Agent.html">Agent</a>s.
  <dt> <a href="javadoc/Package-org.risource.tf.html">org.risource.tf</a>
  <dd> Classes that implement <em>Transaction Features</em> for <a
       href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.Agent.html">Agent</a>s to match.
  <dt> <a href="javadoc/Package-org.risource.util.html">org.risource.util</a>
  <dd> <em>Utility</em> classes, mainly to implement operations that belong on
       standard Java objects, but have to be implemented statically because
       many standard classes can't be extended.
</dl>

Handler classes in
<a href="javadoc/Package-org.risource.dps.handle.html">org.risource.dps.handle</a>,
<a href="javadoc/Package-org.risource.pia.agent.html">org.risource.pia.agent</a>, and
<a href="javadoc/Package-org.risource.tf.html">org.risource.tf</a> are loaded by name when
needed. <p>


<h3>Note:</h3>

This manual is still under construction.  Suggestions about what else to
include would be greatly appreciated.<p>

<h2><a name="resolver">The Resolver</a></h2>

The heart of the PIA is a class called the ``<a
href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.Resolver.html">Resolver</a>'' which makes the
association between HTTP ``<a
href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.Transaction.html">Transaction</a>''s and the
<a href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.Agent.html">Agent</a>s that operate on them.
<p>

The <a href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.Resolver.html">Resolver</a> operates in two
phases:

<ol>
  <li> In the first phase, <a href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.Agent.html">Agent</a>s
       are matched with the <a
       href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.Transaction.html">Transaction</a>'s
       <a href="javadoc/org.risource.ds.Features.html">Feature</a>s according to their
       match <a href="javadoc/org.risource.ds.Criteria.html">Criteria</a>, and are
       allowed to <a href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.Agent.html#actOn">act on</a> the
       matched <a href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.Transaction.html">Transaction</a>.

  <li> In the second, any <a href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.Agent.html">Agent</a>s that
       have been registered (during the first phase) as a ``handler'' are
       invoked to ``<a href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.Transaction.html#satisfy">
       satisfy</a> the <a href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.Transaction.html">
       Transaction</a>, usually by forwarding it to a client or server.
</ol>

Clients and servers are represented in the PIA by proxy objects called
``<a href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.Machine.html">Machine</a>''s which contain the
streams that connect to the client or server, and possibly some associated
information.  A <a href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.Machine.html">Machine</a> is
responsible for the communication protocol required by the client or server to
which it is connected. <p>


<h3>The Resolver Algorithm</h3>

Given a resolver R:

<ol>
  <li> Input:<br>
       Check for incoming messages.  For each message M:
       <ol>
	 <li> Push M onto R's queue Q.
       </ol>
  <li> Next Transaction:<br>
       Shift the next transaction T from Q
  <li> Resolution:<br>
       For each agent A:
       <ol>
	 <li> match A's <code>criteria</code> against T's
	      <code>features</code>. 
	 <li> If A and T match, call A's <code>actOn</code> method with T and
	      R. 
       </ol>
  <li> Satisfaction:<br>
       For each object S on T's <code>satisfiers</code> queue:
       <ol>
	 <li> call S's <code>handle</code> method with T and R.
       </ol>
  <li> Finishing:<br>
       If no S returned <code>true</code>,
       <ol>
	 <li> if T is a request, push an error response onto Q.
	 <li> if T is a response, forward it to its requestor.
       </ol>
  <li> repeat from step 1.
</ol>

<h2><a name="agents">Agents</a></h2>

An Agent in the PIA is represented internally by a class that implements the
<a href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.Agent.html">Agent</a> interface.  In practice, all of
them descend from <a
href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.GenericAgent.html">GenericAgent</a>.  Many Agents are,
in fact, implemented directly by <a
href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.GenericAgent.html">GenericAgent</a>, the main exceptions
at the moment being <a href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.agent.Agency.html">Agency</a>, <a
href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.agent.Dofs.html">Dofs</a>, and <a
href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.agent.Logo.html">Logo</a>.  Cache, when we implement it, will
probably also require its own class.<p>

The main reason for implementing an Agent as a separate class so that the Java
code can grab control before dispatching a URL to an active document.  Efficiency
(<a href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.agent.Agency.html">Agency</a>) and the ability to handle
non-HTML data (<a href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.agent.Logo.html">Logo</a>) also play a part,
although in fact <a href="javadoc/org.risource.pia.agent.Logo.html">Logo</a> is currently
implemented by dispatching to a <code>PERL</code> program.<p>


<hr>
<h2><a name="interforms">The Document Processing System</a></h2>


<h3>The Document Processing Algorithm</h3>
...has been totally rewritten, and greatly simplified.  It used to be a
variant of the PIA's Resolver algorithm, and operated on parse trees that had
been flattened into a stream of ``tokens'', with each element represented as
``start tag'' and ``end tag'' tokens. <p>

The current version is much more efficient, and is based on a subset of the
DOM's TreeIterator interface:  the Input is used for a unidirectional,
depth-first traversal of a parse tree.  An Output is used for
<em>constructing</em> a parse tree, generic DOM Document, or stream.  A
Processor sits between them; its state consists of the current Input, Output,
and entity binding table.  (This is considerably simpler than the old
Processor state, which also included action bindings and traversal state.)<p>

The Input and Output interfaces are designed so that one can copy a document
by traversing it with an Input and passing the resulting nodes to an Output.
Parse trees extend the DOM by decorating each Node with an Action object
(strategy pattern).  Operations implemented by this technique are
<em>local</em> -- an active node in the input document is replaced by one or
more nodes in the output document.  The resulting ``interpretor'' is simple
enough to fit on a single page. <p>

Actions are associated with nodes at parse time; if it can be determined that
a node and its children are all passive, they can be copied without invoking
an action.  Operations with no non-local side-effects (also determinable at
parse time) can be parallelized.<p>

Note that an Output, for example to a character stream, need not
actually construct new nodes, so the new traversal-based interpretor is
significantly more efficient than the old Token-based one.  Copying could be
done iteratively, i.e. without recursion, by keeping track of the current
depth in the input tree.  An Input does this, so this will be a trivial
extension. <p>

At the moment processing is done recursively; calling an action is expected to
fully handle the corresponding node and its children.  It would be simple to
extend handlers to include start and end actions, and allow them to perform
push and  pop operations on the Processor that calls them.  The result would
actually be rather similar to the old Token-based interpretor.  Later. <p>
