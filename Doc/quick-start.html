<p> <strong>This document contains three alternative versions of the ``<a

<h2>Steve's version: for hackers</h2>

<big>
<p> If you are feeling lucky, you can now start the PIA with the command:
</p>

<pre>./PIA/bin/pia ./PIA/Doc</pre>

<blockquote><small>
<p> Assuming all went well, you can now click on the following link: <a
    href="http://localhost:8888/">http://localhost:8888/</a> to point your
    browser at a PIA-based web server that happens to be serving the PIA's
    online documentation.
</small></blockquote>

<p> If that didn't work, try reading the next section on <a
    href="#Setup">Initial Setup</a>, possibly followed by the section on <a
    href="using.html#Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> in
    <a href="using.html">Using the PIA</a>
</p>

<p> If it <em>did</em> work, you should now try to start the PIA in its
    <em>default</em> configuration as a platform for web-based applications,
    with the command:
</p>

<pre>./PIA/bin/pia</pre>

<p> At this point, you know that the PIA is working.  You can now do one of
    three things:
</p>

<ol>
  <li> Go on to the next section to find out how to set up your environment
       variables to make the PIA easier to use.
  <li> Read the online <a href="doclist.html">documentation</a>.
  <li> Play with the <a href="http://localhost:8888/">PIA</a> some more.
</ol>

<h2>Bill's version: for webmasters</h2>


<big>
<em> As a static Web Server...</em>

<blockquote>
<p> Do you have access to a directory (let's call it <code>html_dir</code>) with
     some HTML files in it? (If not, skip to the  <em>"active web
     server"</em> section following). Start the PIA with the command</p>

<p>  <code>PIA/bin/pia  html_dir</code> </p>

<p> [this command tells the PIA to serve files from <code>html_dir</code>; you
    should see some initialization messages and a "Point your browswer to..."
    URL the end.] </p>

<p> Next, view a page file (say <code>my_page.html</code>) by
    pointing your browser as the PIA suggests, for example </p>

<p> <code>http://penguin.crc.ricoh.com:8888/my_page.html</code> </p>

<p> You should see your page displayed, just as if it were displayed by a
    regular web server like Apache. </p>
</blockquote>


<em> As an active Web Server...</em>


<blockquote>

<p> To serve active pages, all you need is some active pages to serve!  So
    copy a <code>home.xh</code> file from one of 
    <code>PIA/Samples/[HelloWorld,FileHandling,Form,PrettyStuff]</code>
    into <code>html_dir</code> (for example, on Unix <code>cp 
    PIA/Samples/HelloWorld/home.xh html_dir/home.xh </code>). </p>

<p> Point the browser at one of these new active pages, e.g. </p>

<p> <code>http://penguin.crc.ricoh.com:8888/home.xh</code> </p>

<p> You should see our page displayed, in which case you can you can learn
    more options for setting up the PIA from the sections below, or you can
    tinker with it (with help from the <a href="author.html#Quick">Author's
    guide</a>). </p>

<p> In the long run you will probably want to serve files from a different
    directory (like the <code>.pia</code> directory described below), and you
    will probably want to have many different "sub-site" directories of active
    pages (see the <a href="author.html#Quick">Author's Guide</a>). </p>

<h2>Greg's Version: a compromise</h2>

<big>
Change your working directory to be the <var>PIA_HOME</var> directory
(e.g. <code>cd PIA </code>).
<p>

You can now start the PIA Web server from the command line:<br /> 
<code>&gt; bin/pia HTML_DOCS</code> <br />

Where <code> HTML_DOCS</code> is the root directory for the files to be served
by the PIA Web server.  (As explained below, you can also specify a
configuration file instead of the root directory.)  "<code>bin/pia</code>" is a
simple wrapper that starts up a java program; you should see some
initialization messages ending with "Point your
browswer to <a href=http://localhost:8888/>http://localhost:8888/</a>" which
indicates that the server is up and running.

<p>

<blockquote>

You can also just run <br /> 
<code>&gt; bin/pia </code> <br /> 
Which uses a default configuration file <code>_subsite.xcf </code> to serve
up pages in the <var>PIA_HOME</var>, which includes the PIA documentation and
example applications.  Running <code> bin/pia </code> and then browsing <a
href=http://localhost:8888/>http://localhost:8888/</a> is the recommended
method for getting acquainted with the capabilities of the PIA.
In particular, <code>Agents/Tutorial </code> and <code>Samples</code> (<a
href=http://localhost:8888/Agents/Tutorial/>http://localhost:8888/Agents/Tutorial/</a>
<a href=http://localhost:8888/Samples/>http://localhost:8888/Samples/</a>)
demonstrate the unique properties of the PIA server side markup language.
