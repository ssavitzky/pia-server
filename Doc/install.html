<h2><a name = "Before"></a>Before You Begin</h2>
<p>
You need the following software to run the PIA:</p>
<ul>
<li> Java (A Java Runtime Environment, <code>JRE 1.1.3</code> or higher, is
     needed to use the software.  Programmers wishing to modify the code will
     need a Java Development Kit <code>JDK</code>.) Java for Solaris and
     Windows can be obtained from <code>
     <a href = "http://www.javasoft.com">java.sun.com</a></code> (direct links
     to <a
     href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.2/jre/index.html">JRE</a> or
     <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.2/">JDK</a>).  Java for
     Linux can be obtained from
     <a href="http://www.blackdown.org/"><code>www.blackdown.org</code></a>
     </li>

<li> An operating system that supports sockets and long filenames.  We
     have run the PIA software on Linux (Red Hat 4.2 -6.0 with the <a
     href="http://www.blackdown.org/">blackdown.org</a> JDK), Windows 9X, and
     Solaris on SPARC.  It does not seem to work on the Macintosh
     because of differences in file handling.
     </li>
<li> Utilities for unpacking the files (<code>tar</code> and
     <code>gunzip</code> on unix, <code>winzip</code> on Windows).
     </li>
</ul>


<h2><a name = "Obtaining">Obtaining the Files</a></h2>
<p>
The PIA files are available via HTTP, from <code>
<a href = "http://www.risource.org/PIA/">http://www.risource.org/PIA/</a>.</code></p>
<p>
The latest stable releases are maintained in compressed form in the
directories <code>ftp://ftp.risource.org/PIA/pia_src.tgz</code>.  This is
always a link to the most recent version.
</p>

<h3>Uncompressing the Files</h3>
<p>
Before the PIA files can be extracted from the tar file, it must first
be uncompressed.  For example:
</p>
<blockquote>
<code>gunzip pia_src.tgz</code>
</blockquote>

<h3>Alternative: CVS</h3>

<p> If you are planning to do PIA <em>development</em>, it is better to obtain
    the files using the CVS version-control system.  More information on this
    can be obtained from <code><a href="http://www.risource.org/PIA/cvs.shtml"
    >www.risource.org/PIA/cvs.shtml</a></code>
</p>

<p> The CVS repository is updated more frequently than the <code>tar</code>
    archive -- essentially whenever a developer feels that the portion of the
    PIA they have been working on is stable enough for others to try.
</p>

<h2><a name = "Installing">Installing the Files</a></h2>
<p>
The files are supplied in the form of a gzip'ed tar file. Set your working
directory to the intended parent directory for the PIA files.
Extract the files using <code>tar</code>.  For example:
</p>

<blockquote><code>tar xvf pia_src</code></blockquote>

<p>
This creates the directory <code>PIA/</code> under your current directory. </p>

<h3 id = "CHDCECIE">Setting Up</h3>
<p>
The
PIA uses two environment variables:</p>
<ul><li><var>PIA_HOME</var> indicates the location of the PIA directory just
installed.</li> 

<li><var>PIA_ROOT</var> indicates the location to which the PIA writes
its data files.</li></ul>

<p>The scripts in the bin directory that run the software attempt to set the
<var>PIA_HOME</var> variable based on the location of the script or the current
working directory.  You may have to explicitly set this variable to the
location of the PIA directory you just installed
(e.g. <code>PIA_HOME=~/PIA</code>).</p>

<p> <var>PIA_ROOT</var> is automatically created by the PIA. You are free to
reset its location if desired.  On Unix, the default directory for
<var>PIA_ROOT</var> is <kbd>~/.pia</kbd>.  On Windows, the default directory is
<code>c:\PIAUSERS\<var>username</var></code> (if a username is not available
<code> nobody</code> is used).</p>

<p>If you use the <kbd>-root</kbd> command line option to specify
<var>PIA_ROOT</var>, that setting takes precedence over the one you specify in
the environment variable.</p>

<!-- === The next two paragraphs need to be changed! === -->
<p>When the PIA starts, it looks for the
<code>pia.props</code> under <code>~/.pia/Config</code>.  You can create a
customizable copy in your home directory under <code>~/.pia/Config</code> by
copying <tt>pia/Config/pia.props</tt> and modifying it using a text
editor. (Note that this example assumes <var>PIA_ROOT is ~/.pia)</var></p>

<p>The default settings of the PIA are contained in
<code>PIA/Config/pia.props</code>. These settings can be overridden by a local
copy of <code>pia.props</code> in <code>PIA_ROOT/Config/pia.props</code>, by
environment variables or on the command line.  Command lines options can be
given in the form of switches (e.g. <code>-p 8000</code>) or at the end of the
command line in the form of <code> prop=value </code> (e.g. <code> pia.port=8000</code>.)
</p>

<p>It is convenient to put the directory <code>$PIA_HOME</code> into your
shell's search path.  On Linux you can do this by putting the following into
your <code>~/.bash_profile</code> file: </p>

<pre>
  # The following line will change depending on where the PIA is installed
  export PIA_HOME=$HOME/PIA
  export PATH=$PIA_HOME/bin:$PATH
</pre>

<p> You may also need to set up Java's <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment
    variable.  The PIA's wrapper script will try to set one up for
    you, but whether it succeeds will depend on how clever your java
    implementation is.  You <em>don't</em> have to have
    <code>$<em>PIA_HOME</em>/src/java</code> in your <code>CLASSPATH</code>;
    the wrapper script <em>is</em> smart enough to add it for you.
</p>

<h2><a name = "Running">Running the PIA </a></h2>

<p>On UNIX or Linux, once you have set up the <code><var>PIA_HOME</var></code>
and <code><var>PIA_ROOT</var></code> environment variables you can launch the
PIA with the command: ``<code>$PIA_HOME/bin/pia</code>'', or just
``<code>pia</code>'' if <code>$PIA_HOME/bin</code> is in your search path.  A
complete list of command-line options can be found by running
<kbd>$PIA_HOME/bin/pia -help</kbd> at the shell prompt.</p>

<p>Under Windows 9x and NT, launch the PIA in a DOS window with the command:
<code><var>PIA_HOME</var>/bin/pia.bat</code> -- this is a batch file that makes
use of the <code><var>PIA_HOME</var></code> and <code><var>PIA_ROOT</var></code>
environment variables, and is similar in function to <code>pia_wrapper</code>
on Unix.</p>

<p>The <code>process</code> command allows the PIA software to be
used as a unix filter for processing HTML and XML documents.  Under Windows 9x
and NT the CLASSPATH must be set to <code><var>PIA_HOME</var>/src/java</code>
in order for <code>process</code> to run.

<h2>Using the PIA</h2>

<p> The PIA acts as a Web server.  Assuming you have gotten the PIA to run in
    its default configuration, you should now be able to browse to <code><a
    href="http://localhost:8888/">http://localhost:8888/</a></code> in order
    to access the PIA's own web pages.  If the default configuration is
    different and you have run the PIA from a command line, it will have
    printed out a line like:
</p>

<pre>
  Point your browser to &lt;URL: http://blackroot.crc.ricoh.com:8001&gt;
</pre>

<p> after initializing, and you can cut-and-paste the URL on that line into
    your browser and go from there. 
</p>

<p>Some of the functions work best if you set your browser's proxies to
the PIA as well. In most cases, <code>http://localhost:8888</code> will
work.</p>
