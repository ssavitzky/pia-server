<h1><a name="Installing">Installing the Files</a></h1>

<big>
<p> After downloading and unpacking the PIA
    files as described in <a
    href="http://www.risource.org/PIA/Downloading.shtml">
    <code>http://www.risource.org/PIA/Downloading.shtml</code></a> you
    should have a directory called <code>PIA</code>; this is the PIA's
    ``<em>home directory</em>'' and will be referred to from now on as
    ``<var>PIA_HOME</var>''.    
</p>

<blockquote><small>

<p> You can unpack the <code>tar</code> archive wherever
    you want the PIA to be installed; typically this will be your home
    directory, or possibly <code>/usr/local</code> or a subdirectory of
    <code>/usr/local/src</code> on a Unix system.
</p>

</small></blockquote>



<hr/>
<h1><a name="Quick">Quick Start</a></h1>
<big>
Change your working directory to be the <var>PIA_HOME</var> directory
(e.g. <code>cd PIA </code>).
<p>

You can now start the PIA Web server from the command line:<br /> 
<code>&gt; bin/pia HTML_DOCS</code> <br />

Where <code> HTML_DOCS</code> is the root directory for the files to be served
by the PIA Web server.  (As explained below, you can also specify a
configuration file instead of the root directory.)  "<code>bin/pia</code>" is a
simple wrapper that starts up a java program; you should see some
initialization messages ending with "Point your
browswer to <a href=http://localhost:8888/>http://localhost:8888/</a>" which
indicates that the server is up and running.

<p>

<blockquote>

You can also just run <br /> 
<code>&gt; bin/pia </code> <br /> 
Which uses a default configuration file <code>_subsite.xcf </code> to serve
up pages in the <var>PIA_HOME</var>, which includes the PIA documentation and
example applications.  Running <code> bin/pia </code> and then browsing <a
href=http://localhost:8888/>http://localhost:8888/</a> is the recommended
method for getting acquainted with the capabilities of the PIA.
In particular, <code>Agents/Tutorial </code> and <code>Samples</code> (<a
href=http://localhost:8888/Agents/Tutorial/>http://localhost:8888/Agents/Tutorial/</a>
<a href=http://localhost:8888/Samples/>http://localhost:8888/Samples/</a>)
demonstrate the unique properties of the PIA server side markup language.

<h1><a name="Setup">Setup Details</a></h1>

<big>

<p> There are three prerequisites to successfully running the PIA web server:
</p>

<ol>
  <li> A Java Virtual Machine (JVM) must be installed.  The PIA startup
       scripts expect that the <code>java </code> program is accessible
       through your <code>PATH </code> environment variable.
  <li> The PIA's class files must be accessible.  The startup scripts expect
       to find the class files in the <code>src/java</code> subdirectory of
       the <var>PIA_HOME</var> directory.  Note that in the default
       configuration, <var>PIA_HOME</var> is also used as the <i>"virtual
       root"</i> directory for the server.  (See below for an explanation of
       virtual roots.)
  <li> A root directory where pages are served from and where applications can write
       data files. This is called the PIA's
       ``<em>root</em>'' directory, or <var>PIA_ROOT</var>.  Note that in the
       default configuration, this is a specified as <code>~/.pia </code>
</ol>

<blockquote><small>

<p> Values for <var>PIA_HOME</var> and <var>PIA_ROOT</var> can be specified in
    environment variables or on the command line. (See <a
    href="using.html">Using the PIA</a>.)  Various other variables can be
    specified on the command line or in the configuration file.</p>

<h4>Virtual Root directory</h4>

<p> In many Web applications, it is desirable to have a core set of pages that
    are the same for many different sites intermingled with some pages that
    are customized for a particular site.  Normally one would like to update
    the shared pages using a tool like CVS without affecting the locally
    customized pages.  The PIA Web server makes this kind of operation very
    easy to using the concept of a "Virtual root directory."  When the Web
    server receives a request for a page, it first looks in the "real" root
    directory, <var>PIA_ROOT</var>.  If they requested page does not exist in
    that hierarchy, then the server looks in the "Virtual root" hierarchy (if
    one has been specified). 

<p> In the default configuration,
    <var>PIA_HOME</var> is specified as the "Virtual root."  This makes it
    easy to use the sample applications and update them using CVS while
    allowing you to make customizations in <var>PIA_ROOT</var>.  Note that
    when a PIA application needs to store a file on disk, it does so under the
    <var>PIA_ROOT</var> hierarchy.  (Note that <var>PIA_HOME</var> could even
    be on CD-ROM because the PIA
    <em>never</em> tries to write files there!).

<p><em>Experts only:</em> The directory <var>PIA_HOME</var>, as described
above, actually refers to two funtionally different locations, which can be
addressed separately.  One is where the java classes and executables live;
that is always and forever <var>PIA_HOME</var>.  The other location---the
<em>"virtual root,"</em>, is where the PIA looks for applications it can't find
in <var>PIA_ROOT</var>---can in principle be any directory.  You can set the <em> virtual root</em> to be some third directory
by using the <code>-vroot</code> command-line option when starting the PIA,
but we don't recommend it for beginners.... not only is it confusing, but your
PIA server would no longer have access to cvs-updated applications in the
<code>Agents, Samples</code>, and <code>Contrib</code> directories. </p>

<p> In summary,  the PIA look for its java class files under
    <code>PIA_HOME</code>, and the web server looks first for  applications/pages in
    <code>PIA_ROOT</code> then in the <em>virtual
    root</em>. </p>


</small></blockquote>



<p> As a consequence of this arrangement, <strong> we recommend you don't edit
    <i>anything</i> in <var>PIA_HOME</var>, which is automatically
    updated/overwritten by CVS, unless you are actively working on the PIA
    codebase or improving the sample applications.</strong> Instead, write everything under <var>PIA_ROOT</var>
    (e.g. <kbd>~/.pia</kbd>). </p>

<blockquote><small>
  <p> Most people will develop applications by making a new subdirectory
      of <code><var>PIA_ROOT</var>/Agents/</code>, then copying in pages
      from the <code>PIA/Samples</code> directory or from other applications.
      
  </p>
</small></blockquote>

<p> The default values for these variables should work in most cases:
</p>

<blockquote><small>

<p> The executable scripts (e.g. <code>bin/pia</code>) attempt to set the
    <var>PIA_HOME</var> variable based on the location of the script or the
    current working directory.  But if you
    want to run the pia from a different location, or run a different version,
    you may have to explicitly set this variable to the location of the PIA
    directory you just installed.
</p>

<p> The directory <var>PIA_ROOT</var> can be set on the command line with the <kbd>-root</kbd> option, or by
    setting the environment variable <var>PIA_ROOT</var>.  On Unix, the
    default location for <var>PIA_ROOT</var> is <kbd>~/.pia</kbd>.  On
    Windows, the default directory is
    <code>c:\PIAUSERS\<var>username</var></code> (if a username is not
    available <code> nobody</code> is used).
</p>

<p> If you use the <kbd>-root</kbd> or <kbd>-home</kbd> command line option to
    specify <var>PIA_ROOT</var> or <kbd>PIA_HOME</kbd>, that setting takes
    precedence over the one you specify in the corresponding environment
    variable.
</p>

<p>It is convenient to put the directory <code><var>PIA_HOME</var>/bin</code>,
which contains scripts (including the one that implements the <code>pia</code>
command!)  into your shell's search path.  You may also want to specify a
different root.  On Linux you can do all of this by putting the following into
your <code>~/.bash_profile</code> file: </p>

<pre>
  # The following line will change depending on where the PIA is installed
  export PIA_HOME=$HOME/PIA
  export PATH=$PIA_HOME/bin:$PATH
  export PIA_ROOT=$HOME/.pia
</pre>

<p> This setup is not necessary if you always run the PIA using the command
    ``<code>PIA/bin/pia</code>'', but most users find this to be inconvenient.
</p>

<p> You may also need to set up Java's <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment
    variable.  The PIA's wrapper script will try to set one up for
    you, but whether it succeeds will depend on how clever your java
    implementation is.  You <em>don't</em> have to have
    <code><em>PIA_HOME</em>/src/java</code> in your <code>CLASSPATH</code>;
    the wrapper script <em>is</em> smart enough to add it for you.
</p>

<p> In addition, if you don't like the way this document looks because the
    difference in size between large and small fonts is too great, consider
    adding the following line to your <code>.Xdefaults</code> file.  Adjust
    the number to suit yourself; the default is 20 (percent).
</p>

<pre>
  Netscape*documentFonts.sizeIncrement:	15

<h1><a name="Running">Running the PIA </a></h1>

<big>
<ul>
  <li> See the <a href="#Quick">Quick Start</a> section for the commands 
       for running the PIA without setup.
  <li> If you have done the initial setup described above, you should be able
       to use the command <code>pia</code> by itself.
  <li> <code>pia -help</code> will display all of the command-line options
  <li> See <a href="using.html">Using the PIA</a> for more information,
       including the available command line and configuration file options.
</ul>

<blockquote><small>

<p>On UNIX or Linux, once you have set up the <code><var>PIA_HOME</var></code>
and <code><var>PIA_ROOT</var></code> environment variables and put
<code><var>PIA_HOME</var>/bin</code> in your search path as described in the
previous section, you should be able to start the PIA with the command:
``<code>pia</code>'' A complete list of command-line options can be found by
running <kbd>$PIA_HOME/bin/pia -help</kbd> at the shell prompt.</p>

<p>Under Windows 9x and NT, launch the PIA in a DOS window with the command:
<code><var>PIA_HOME</var>/bin/pia.bat</code> -- this is a batch file that makes
use of the <code><var>PIA_HOME</var></code> and <code><var>PIA_ROOT</var></code>
environment variables, and is similar in function to <code>pia_wrapper</code>
on Unix.</p>

</small></blockquote>

<h1>Using the PIA</h1>

<p> The PIA acts as a Web server.  Assuming you have gotten the PIA to run in
    its default configuration, you should now be able to browse to <code><a
    href="http://localhost:8888/">http://localhost:8888/</a></code> in order
    to access the PIA's own web pages. </p>

<blockquote><small>

<p>If the default configuration is
    different and you have run the PIA from a command line, it will have
    printed out a line like:
</p>

<pre>
  Point your browser to &lt;URL: http://blackroot.crc.ricoh.com:8001&gt;
</pre>

<p> after initializing, and you can cut-and-paste the URL on that line into
    your browser and go from there. 
</p>

<p> There are some applications---such as a browser proxy and browsing-history
    system---which require that your browser use the PIA as a proxy.  This
    enables the PIA to process any incoming and outgoing pages as you would
    like.  See the <code>Proxie</code> agent for more details.
</p>

<p> It is also possible to use the PIA ``off line'' from the command line, as
    a pure document processor.  See <a href="using.html#Processing">Using the
    PIA</a>.
