<h1>Notes on Porting the PIA</h1>
<h3>(to embedded systems)</h3>

<h2>Alternatives</h2>
<h3>OS Alternatives:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> VxWorks -- already in use.
  <li> <a href="http://www.cygnus.com/ecos/">eCOS</a> -- attractive, but
       requires C++ for some components; hasn't been ported to many processors
       yet. 
</ul>

<h3>Language Alternatives:</h3>
<ul>
  <li> C: Hard to port, but size/performance likely to be acceptable.
  <li> Scheme+DSSSL.<br>
       DSSSL is the standard style-sheet language for SGML; it's based on the
       Scheme (a Lisp variant) programming language.  Most implementations, I
       believe, are based on either the Guile or SIOD implementation of
       Scheme, both of which are in C and fairly lightweight.  Parsers exist;
       data structures and memory management are free.
  <li> Java: trivial to port, but probably too big/slow. <br>
       <a href="http://www.cygnus.com/product/javalang/">Cygnus</a> is working
       on it, but too preliminary at this point.  VxWorks JVM's exist, but
       probably not for Hitachi CPU's.
  <li> C++: Easier to port to than C; possibly worse size/speed.
  <li> Perl/Python/Smalltalk: Easier to port to than C/C++, but unfamiliar. <br>
       Data structures and memory management come free; XML and HTML parsers
       exist.  (There are web browsers and servers in Smalltalk already).
       Smalltalk has a history of being used in embedded applications, but is
       likely to be slow and bulky.
</ul>

Note that the <a href="http://egcs.cygnus.com/">EGCS</a> compilers now
supports the SH4 processor; this comes from Cygnus's <a
href="http://www.cygnus.com/gnupro/">GNUPro</a>.  It may not support the SH3.

<h2>C Porting Considerations</h2>

<h3>Memory Management</h3>
<ul>
  <li> This is by far the hardest problem in a C port.  You will have to use
       one of the following techniques (or possibly some mixture of them):
       <ol>
	 <li> Zoned allocation.  While you're processing a document, allocate
	      all of its memory from one or more contiguous blocks.  When
	      you're finished with a document, throw away all of the memory
	      you allocated for it.  Keep a special block for global
	      structures, which never get de-allocated.  This is probably
	      the best technique.
	 <li> Reference counts.  Straightforward but somewhat error-prone.
	 <li> Being careful.  If you can <em>guarantee</em> that every data
	      structure is a tree, and that no objects are shared among trees,
	      then you know that when you are finished with a document you can
	      recursively de-allocate its entire tree. 
	 <li> Garbage collection.  Hard unless you can find a pre-packaged
	      version. 
       </ol>
  <li> In some cases, it can be <em>guaranteed</em> that certain objects are
       only referenced in one place.  For example, the variable-sized portion
       of growable buffers or arrays.  These are easily managed with a
       compacting garbage-collector. 
  <li> Fixed-size nodes can be allocated off a free list. 
</ul>

<h3>Threads</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Multi-threading interacts (badly, in most cases) with memory
       management.  
  <li> Probably the techniques easiest to make thread-safe are zoned
       allocation and being careful.
  <li> Even if a thread-safe allocator is in use, sharing data structures
       (and hence documentsa) among threads is likely to be difficult.
  <li> Currently, the only place where documents are shared among threads is
       when proxying is being done; it may be possible to avoid this.

</ul>

<h3>Available Resources</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Mozilla<br>
       Has a DOM in C++ (unfortunately), along with XML and HTML parsers.
  <li> Other XML parsers exist.
       <ul>
	 <li> An XML parser would have to be extended slightly to handle tags
	      that the tagset flags as "empty", i.e. not requiring either a
	      "/" delimiter or an end tag.  These can occur in HTML, but not
	      in XML.

	 <li> An HTML parser would also want to handle missing end tags (for
	      example, on list items).  This is not essential in an embedded
	      application, because you can ensure that all end tags are
	      supplied where needed.  If necessary, you could use a working
	      Java PIA as a pre-processor.
       </ul>

  <li> PERL<br>
       has data structures very similar to the ones in <code>crc.ds</code>; in
       fact the <code>ds</code> module was originally designed to make a port
       from PERL to Java as simple as possible.  

  <li> Apache<br>
       is a well-known web server written in C, and has some marketing
       advantages as well.  It would replace the basic web server level
       (Acceptor, Transaction, Resolver) with its own machinery; Agents would
       probably be mapped into modules.
</ul>

<h3>Translating Java to C</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Translating method calls.<br>
       These translate into a function call with the object being operated on
       as the first argument.
  <li> Translating an Interface<br>
       (to a <code>struct</code> of pointers to functions).
  <li> Translating a Class<br>
       (to a <code>struct</code> plus interface functions).  Every instance of
       a class has a pointer to the class-definition structure, which in turn
       has pointers to the method functions.
  <li> Dynamic Method Dispatching<br>
       This is done by going indirect through an object's class-definition
       structure to find the appropriate function.  A good example of this can
       be found in the X Toolkit. 
</ul>

<h3>Translating XML to C</h3>
<ul>
  <li> There are basically two ways to do this:
       <ol>
	 <li> Translate XML into initialized C data structures.  This
	      eliminates the parsing step, and makes your system much more
	      efficient.  It requires creating a lot of initialized data
	      structures with funny names.
	 <li> Translate (active) XML into C procedures.  A ``document'' would
	      simply be a procedure that outputs (probably to an Output object
	      rather than to a stream) the result of expanding the document
	      with the DPS.  This is essentially the same process that a
	      parser-generator goes through.  Provides very high performance
	      but very little flexibility -- the document cannot be changed at
	      run-time. 
       </ol>
</ul>

<h3>What is Essential?</h3>
<div align=center><em>
  This is roughly equivalent to ``where to start.''
</em></div> 
<ul>
  <li> Data structures defined in <code>crc.ds</code>.  These are basically a
       portable data structure library, and everything in the PIA can be built
       out of them.  In particular, <code>List</code> and <code>Table</code>
       are <em>almost essential</em>.
  <li> You will probably have to add a string datatype. 
  <li> The basic server classes: <code>crc.pia.Acceptor</code>,
       <code>crc.pia.Transaction</code>, the <code>crc.pia.Content</code>
       interface and at least some of its implementations.  These can probably
       be omitted if Apache is used as the server base.
  <li> The <code>crc.pia.Agent</code> interface and its implementations
       <code>crc.pia.GenericAgent</code>, <code>crc.pia.agent.Admin</code>,
       and <code>crc.pia.Root</code>.  Possibly <code>crc.pia.agent.Dofs</code>.
       These are essential for actually serving pages, no matter how they are
       eventually implemented.
  <li> The DOM objects.  In embedded applications, it should be possible to
       pre-parse all the documents and convert them to C data structures,
       though this is not necessarily a good itea.
  <li> The Document Processing System, in the <code>crc.dps</code> package.
       The main loop, in <code>crc.dps.process.BasicProcessor</code>, is
       essentially trivial.  You will also need the handlers, tagsets, and
       some of the Input and Output implementations. 
</ul>

<h3>What can be Left Out?</h3>
<ul>
  <li> Everything in <code>crc.interform</code> -- this is the old InterForm
       interpretor, and is completely replaced by <code>crc.dps</code>, the
       new Document Processing System.  We are in the process of removing it,
       since it will not be part of the released code. 
  <li> Certainly, any agents (in <code>pia/Agents</code> and
       <code>crc.pia.agent</code>) that you don't need.  Probably the only
       ones you'll need are <code>Admin</code>, <code>Root</code> and
       <code>DOFS</code>. <code>Admin</code> should be severely restricted,
       and <code>Root</code> will probably be totally changed. 
  <li> The Resolver (in <code>crc.pia.Resolver</code>) can be left out if you
       don't want to use your device as a proxy.  A lot of other machinery
       could go away if you got rid of this -- essentially you'd be left with
       an ordinary web server that replaces CGI scripts with the DPS and its
       active documents.
  <li> Everything having to do with Java serialized objects (implemented using
       <code>crc.util.Utilities.readObjectFrom</code> and
       <code>writeObjectTo</code>.  Unfortunately there are other things in
       <code>Utilities</code> that you may need.
  <li> You could leave out the parser (<code>crc.dps.parse</code>) if you used
       pre-build data structures for the parse trees of all your documents.
       This would make your system significantly faster and reduce the amount
       of RAM needed, but would leave it impossible to customize.
  <li> Logging and debugging code should be implemented using macros so that
       it can easily be removed from the production system. 
</ul>

<h3>What's Disorganized?</h3>

<blockquote><em>
  Several parts of the system are ``disorganized'' -- left in an incomplete or
  confusing state because we simply haven't had time to give them the
  attention they deserve.  If you're doing a port, these parts should be done
  right instead of simply being copied. 
</em></blockquote>

<ul>
  <li> <code>crc.dom</code> and <code>crc.dps.active</code> implement an
       <em>obsolete version</em> of the W3C's Document Object Model.  The most
       recent version of the interfaces is in <code>org.w3c.dom</code>; the
       entire DPS needs to be rewritten to use it.  This will probably be
       done sometime in late March, 1999.  The names of several classes and
       methods will have to be changed.  The basic algorithms will stay
       intact, however.
  <li> <code>crc.pia</code> needs to be re-organized to make better use of
       interfaces.  <code>crc.pia.Agent</code> is far too complicated;
       <code>crc.pia.Transaction</code> is also too complex and should be
       redone as an interface.
  <li> <code>crc.pia.GenericAgent</code> is far too complex; it needs to be
       split up and simplified:
       <ul>
	 <li> The file lookup code in <code>crc.pia.GenericAgent</code>
	      (including <code>findInterformFile</code> and so on) needs to
	      get moved to a separate utility class.  Compare
	      <code>crc.pia.FileAccess</code>, which is probably where it
	      should go.
	 <li> The methods in <code>crc.pia.GenericAgent</code> that put
	      together various kinds of response transaction could also go
	      into a utility class.
	 <li> <code>dirAttribute</code> and <code>fileAttribute</code> need to
	      be worked on; they're left over from an older version.
       </ul>
  <li> Quite a lot of test scaffolding has been left in some classes. 
</ul>

<h3>Recommended Sequence</h3>

<ol>
  <li> crc.ds.{Table, List}
  <li> crc.dps.active.{ParseTreeNode, ParseTreeText, ParseTreeElement, ...}
  <li> crc.dps.output.ToParseTree<br>
       at this point you can build parse trees in memory.  Any parser can
       construct them.
  <li> crc.dps.input.FromParseTree
  <li> crc.dps.output.ToExternalForm<br>
       at this point you can traverse a parse tree and output it as a
       character stream.
  <li> crc.dps.handle.{BasicHandler, GenericHandler}
  <li> crc.dps.util.{BasicNamespace, BasicEntityTable}; other classes  in util
       as needed.  Most of them are simple.  Many are just class wrappers for
       a lot of global functions.
  <li> crc.dps.process.BasicProcessor<br>
       At this point you can actually <em>process</em> documents.  You can
       parse them offline and create initialized C data structures if you
       like. 
  <li> crc.dps.parse.BasicParser<br>
       This is optional -- you only need it if you are going to process
       documents that are represented as character strings.  If you can stick
       with parse trees, you can leave it out.
  <li> Handler classes for the tags you need. 
</ol>

<p> In <em>parallel</em> with this you should be prototyping the user
    interface using a working PIA -- this will give you something you can
    interact with and test, and will tell you <em>exactly</em> which parts of
    the PIA you need to implement.

<h2>Scheme/DSSSL Porting Considerations</h2>

<ul>
  <li> I would like to see this done on general principles.  My guess is that
       an average Lisp programmer could put a first cut together in a couple
       of days. 
  <li> A DSSSL port of the DPS, in particular, should be almost completely
       trivial.  Probably just a matter of translating each active tag's
       handler into a Scheme function.
  <li> A tagset-to-DTD translator would have to be written, since the existing
       parsers all run off a standard DTD.
  <li> There are certainly some web servers written in Common Lisp; it
       wouldn't be surprising if there's at least one in Scheme as well.  This
       would give us the front end. 
</ul>
