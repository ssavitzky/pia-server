<h1>Projects</h1>

<p> This is Steve Savitzky's personal list of things that ``it would be nice
    if'' somebody <em>else</em> could do.

<h2>Ports</h2>

<p> These are covered in more detail in <a
    href="porting.html"><code>porting</code></a>.

<h3>C</h3>

<p> The server portion of a C port could be built on top of Apache.  Certainly
    the DPS could easily be made into a module.  Adding Agent functionality to
    Apache would be somewhat harder. 

<p> In any case, an Apache ``<code>modDPS</code>'' would be a worthwhile thing
    to have. 

<h3>Scheme/Guile/DSSSL</h3>

<p> The standard SGML style language DSSSL is basically a set of functions
    built on top of Scheme.  SGML parsers exist, obviously.  A DSSSL version
    of the DPS should be trivial.

<h2>Parsers</h2>

<p> Most SGML parsers in the ``real world'' operate in ``push'' mode -- they
    call an action routine whenever a tag or text node is encountered.  The
    PIA, in contrast, operates in ``pull'' mode, requesting nodes from the
    parser.

<p> In order to interface a standard parser to the PIA (which would be a good
    idea for many reasons) one would have to do one of the following:

<ul>
  <li> generate a complete parse tree (as a DOM Document) and traverse it with
       an Input.  Trivial, but requires the entire document to be in memory.

  <li> use two threads, with a queue holding nodes that have not yet been
       traversed by the DPS.

  <li> Revise the DPS to operate entirely in push mode.  The old Interform
       interpretor could do this; it involves building partial parse trees for
       the content of active tags.
</ul>


<h2>Alternate Document Representations</h2>

<h3>Object Database</h3>

<p> By putting DOM objects in an ODBMS, one could totally replace the
    filesystem.  One would, of course, still need a parser for incoming HTML.

<h3>CORBA DOM</h3>

<p> Assuming a CORBA-compatible DOM implementation existed (since it's defined
    in IDL it probably wouldn't be hard), one could use it for document
    storage.
