<h1>Utility Tagsets</h1>

<blockquote>
  <p> This document proposes a set of ``utility tagsets'' that would each
      provide some common function shared across a wide range of
      applications.  
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Development Aids</h2>

<h3>Debugging</h3>

<p> We already have an example here: the <code>debug.ts</code> tagset.
</p>

<h3>Simplified Arithmetic</h3>

<p> &lt;numeric op="product"&gt; is all very well, but wouldn't you really
    rather have &lt;add&gt; and &lt;mult&gt;?
</p>

<h3>Simplified Text Manipulation</h3>


<h3>Simplified File Manipulation</h3>



<h2>Page Components</h2>

<h3>Form Elements</h3>

<p> The form elements being developed for the Workflow application are a good
    start.  The point is that these elements will be useful in <em>many</em>
    applications, not just an office form system.
</p>


<h3>Spreadsheet Elements</h3>

<p> The idea of combining a tabular layout with computation, so that some
    cells contain data and some contain formulae, could be very useful for
    laying out forms.  Allowing database access, text manipulation,
    &lt;include&gt;, and &lt;extract&gt; would allow things like Greg's
    portfolio example, actual financial spreadsheets, and so on.
</p>

<h3>Worksheet Elements</h3>

<p> These are basically spreadsheet elements without the tabular layout, with
    each element simply identified by its name.  This permits a more natural
    layout for, e.g., lab notebooks, with formula objects embedded in running
    text. 
</p>

<h3>Calendar Elements</h3>

<p> These would be simplified and cleaned-up versions of the tags used in the
    Calendar application. 
</p>

<h3>Decorations</h3>

<p> A decoration, as the name implies, is a simple piece of layout intended to
    make a page ``look good''.  Decorations usually involve some combination
    of tables and small images, and include such things as rounded corners,
    drop shadows, decorative margins, and so on.
