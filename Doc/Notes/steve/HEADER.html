<p> This directory contains working notes by <a
    href="http://rii.ricoh.com/~steve">Steve Savitzky</a>
    &lt;steve@rii.ricoh.com&gt;.  At various times it may include to-do lists,
    random ideas about the PIA and agents, design and implementation notes,
    rough drafts, and so on.

<p> The contents of this directory are subject to change without notice, and
    are not guaranteed to have more than a tenuous relationship with the state
    of the PIA at any given time.
