  This document describes, at a very high level, where I think the PIA ought
  to be going over the next few months.

<h2><a name="XML-rep">Agents and Tagsets in XML</a></h2>

<blockquote><strong>
  This is in progress.
  See <a href="Design/xml-world.html">Design/xml-world.html</a>
</strong></blockquote>

<p> The goal here is to represent as many PIA internal objects as possible in
    XML; in other words, to be able to write and read them as XML documents.
    <em>(Agent and Namespace have been completed; Tagset is less critical
    since they are already defined in XML, so writing them out is less
    necessary.)</em>

<h2><a name="DOM">Improved Document Representation</a></h2>

<blockquote><strong>This is in progress.
  See <a href="Design/dom.html">Design/dom.html</a> </strong>
</blockquote>

<p> The goal here is to make the internal representation of parse trees
    conform completely to the W3C's Document Object Model <em>(this part has
    been completed as of 1999-04-15)</em>, and then to make the DPS almost
    completely independent of the DOM implementation by moving it to a
    cursor-based access model (<em>still in progress)</em>.

<h2>Language Improvements</h2>

<blockquote>

 <p> `When I use a word,' Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, `it
     means just what I choose it to mean -- neither more nor less.' 

 <p> `The question is,' said Alice, `whether you <em>can</em> make words mean
     so many different things.'  

 <p> `The question is,' said Humpty Dumpty, `which is to be master - - that's
     all.'  
  <p> -- <em>Lewis Carrol</em>

<h3>XML compliance</h3>

<p> For better or for worse, XML has moved farther apart from HTML.  Its
    proponents would like to drag HTML along for the ride, and use strict XML
    for <em>everything</em> on the Web.  I don't necessarily hold with this
    view, but as long as the PIA has been touted as an XML-based system we
    have to go along at least part of the way, and make our language as
    strictly XML-compliant as we can.

<p> At this point there are really only two places where we differ from XML:

<ol>
  <li> Our use of namespaces diverges a great deal from XML's, to the point
       where an XML application that is aware of namespaces might not be able
       to deal with our <code>.xh</code> files.  On the other hand it might;
       XML doesn't appear to recognize namespaces in entity names.
  <li> Our language was designed with SGML attribute minimization in mind.
       The resulting constructs (e.g. ``<code>foo="foo"</code>'' are often
       particularly ugly in XML.
</ol>

<h3>Namespaces</h3>

<p> In order to accomodate XML namespaces, we may want to use  a different
    character as our namespace separator.  Dash, period, and underscore are
    available; period would seem to be the best substitute.  

<h3>Attributes</h3>

<p> SGML allows attributes to be minimized in two different ways:
<ol>
  <li> an attribute with no value specified evaluates to its name
  <li> by requiring that enumerated values be unique across all the attributes
       of an element, an enumerated value can be assigned to its proper
       attribute
</ol>

<p> HTML makes use only of the first but, as we will see below, we can take
    advantage of the second in writing a cleanup tagset.

<p> There are basically five ways to ``pretty-up'' attributes:

<ol>
  <li> Move the offending attributes into tag names.  In other words, use
       &lt;test.zero&gt; instead of &lt;test zero&gt;.
  <li> Turn them from attribute names to values.  For example, transform
       &lt;numeric sum&gt; into &lt;numeric op="sum"&gt;.
  <li> Give their value a useful meaning.
  <li> Move from two attributes, one of which is boolean, to two attributes
       with values, one of which is optional.  An example from the
       <em>old</em> language was &lt;read file=<em>filename</em>&gt;
       vs. &lt;read href=<em>url</em>&gt;.
  <li> Move data from attributes to sub-elements.  We did that when we moved
       from &lt;repeat list=<em>list</em>&gt; to
       &lt;repeat&gt;&lt;foreach&gt;<em>list</em>
       &lt;/foreach&gt;&lt;/repeat&gt;.  
</ol>

<p> Most likely, some combination of all of these will be required in order to
    redesign the language so that it is both fully XML-compliant and easily
    human-readable.

<h4>Implementation Note</h4>

<p> <code>GenericHandler</code> already has a method called
    <code>dispatch</code> that can handle the first three methods above:  it
    will recognize a keyword either as an attribute name, the value of a
    specified attribute, or a suffix to the tag name.
