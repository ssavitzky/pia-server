       objects.
</dl>

<p> The goal here is to represent as many PIA internal objects as possible in
    XML.  This is comparatively easy:  we have an interface, ActiveElement,
    that satisfies both DOM and DPS requirements, and an implementation for it
    (currently called <code>ParseTreeGeneric</code>) that is easy to
    subclass. 

<p> The parser is already capable of building elements with classes other than
    the default ParseTreeElement, but this capability has not been tested and
    more work needs to be done.

<p> There are two main ways to represent PIA objects as XML: make them
    subclasses of an existing ActiveElement implementation, or make them
    independent implementations.  It is significantly easier to put them into
    existing structures if they inherit from the same base class as our
    existing parse trees, and it simplifies the implementation as well.

<p> A third technique exists: to <em>wrap</em> the PIA objects.  This is
    presently being done with Agent (using NamespaceWrap), but although it
    makes it possible to put the wrapped objects into an XML document, it
    means that you have to build a separate handler to do the construction.

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<p> Some of the benefits that would result from an XML representation are:

<ul>
  <li> When something is represented as XML, i.e. as a parse tree, it becomes
       much easier to manipulate it using our XXML tag language.
  <li> XML objects are more efficient to construct.  Currently, in order to
       initialize something like a tagset, we have to:
       <ul>
	 <li> parse a document containing &lt;define&gt; tags
	 <li> call on the <code>defineHandler</code> to interpret those tags
	 <li> initialize the object by calling specialized methods known only
	      to <code>defineHandler</code>
       </ul>
       <p> An XML representation would eliminate all but the first step:
	   constructing the parse tree would <em>in itself</em> construct the
	   object.
  <li> XML objects can be written out in a form that can be read back in.
       Currently agents, tagsets and namespaces can't easily be converted to
       an external form, because they don't map directly into XML. 
  <li> XML-represented objects can easily be manipulated by other tools.
</ul>

<h3>Targets</h3>

<p> Some of the objects that could be represented in XML (in approximate order
    of increasing complexity of implementation):

<dl>
  <dt> Tagsets and Namespaces
  <dd> Actually, BasicTagset and BasicNamespace <em>already</em> inherit from
       ParseTreeGeneric.  The only difficulty is that there is no set of
       handlers to construct them directly from XML documents, and writing
       them out doesn't produce something that could be read back in because
       the implementation is incomplete.  The &lt;define&gt; tag imposes an
       extra layer of indirection.
  <dt> Agents
  <dd> Presently these are simply wrapped as namespaces; it might work better
       if some components (<code>name</code>, <code>path</code>, and the
       directories, for example) were attributes.  Not essential, though.
       There is a complexity for agents: if you don't know <em>both</em> the
       home and user directories at initialization time, you don't know where
       to look for the XML metadata.
  <dt> Match Criteria
  <dd> Presently an agent's criteria are initialized by means of a rather
       simpleminded conversion from strings.  It would be easier if
       they were real XML.
  <dt> Transactions
  <dd> There's a lot of complexity in Transaction and its subclasses that
       might go away if they were XML.  There would be the further advantage
       that many of the computations that need to be done on them could be
       done via XXML rather than Java.  It's not <em>entirely</em> clear that
       this would be a good idea, however.
  <dt> Features 
  <dd> The little objects that compute transaction features could
       <em>also</em> be XML code, but this is probably <em>not</em> a good
       idea, since it would be very inefficient.  It's not unreasonable to
       surface the features themselves as attributes, however.
</dl>

<p> Note that this list is <em>not</em> in order of implementation priority;
    it's not clear whether to do tagsets or agents first. 

<h3>Advanced: XML serialization of arbitrary objects</h3>

<p> There's actually a straightforward way to represent <em>any</em> Java
    object as an XML element:

<ul>
  <li> Represent all numeric, boolean, and String instance variables as
       attributes. 
  <li> Represent all other instance variables as sub-elements. 
  <li> Use the class name as the tagname.
</ul>

<p> It wouldn't surprise me much if there were already code available to do
    this.  It has some problems:  since it doesn't map easily into the DOM,
    one can't directly manipulate such an object from XXML code.  Also,
    without some additional metadata, linked structures get <em>very</em> ugly
    and don't map into the most obvious XML representation.


<h2>Improved Document Representation</h2>

<h3>The Two Great World Systems</h3>

<h4>The DOM</h4>

<p> The DOM presently DOMinates the field of Java representations for XML
    documents (parse trees).  Essentially, it's the only game in town.
    Unfortunately it has some problems:

<ul>
  <li> Live NodeList's are notoriously hard to implement efficiently. 
  <li> DOM Level 2's Iterator interface is defined as throwing an exception
       when the structure it is iterating over is modified.
  <li> The obvious representation as doubly-linked trees has quite a lot of
       storage and processing overhead. 
  <li> There is simply no way to move a node from one document to another, or
       to have an isolated node that is not part of a document.
  <li> There is no representation for element or attribute definitions in the
       DocumentType interface, so a DTD cannot be completely represented. 
  <li> Information about quote characters, implied end tags (in HTML), and so
       on is lost.  It is impossible to reconstruct a document from its DOM
       representation.  
</ul>

<p> Also, there is no place in the DOM for the kind of metadata (e.g.,
    handlers) that the DPS needs in order to do its job.  This by itself is
    enough to require the PIA to have its own implementation of the DOM.

<h4>Cursors</h4>

<p> The DPS notion of a Cursor evolved out the (subsequently abandoned) DOM
    interface TreeIterator.  The basic idea is that a Cursor allows the DPS to
    <em>traverse</em> a DOM tree, or what <em>appears to be</em> a DOM tree,
    without actually looking at the DOM nodes themselves.

<p> Presently there is a lot of leakage between the DOM and the DPS, and the
    current version of Cursor actually <em>does</em> allow (and in fact
    require) access to the DOM node.  This can be fixed, however.

<p> The result would be a purely ``cursorial'' interface to documents,
    <em>completely</em> independent of the DOM's ``arboreal'' interfaces.

<blockquote>
<dl>
  <dt> Linguistic side-note:
  <dd> In paleontology, ``cursorial'' refers to the hypothesis that dinosaurs
       evolved into birds by running after flying insects with their
       (feathered) forelimbs outstretched.  This contrasts with the
       ``arboreal'' hypothesis, that wings evolved to improve dinosaurs'
       ability to jump out of trees.
</dl>
</blockquote>

<h3>Benefits</h3>

A split model, DOM + Cursors, would have several advantages:

<ul>
  <li> By reducing the number of things in the PIA that actually depend on the
       DOM interfaces, it would be easier to transition the PIA from the old
       DOM interfaces it is using now to the current, official ones.
  <li> Any DOM could be ``dropped in'' by providing suitable cursors. 
  <li> The PIA can operate by side-stepping the DOM's interfaces rather than
       by abusing them, as it presently does.
  <li> The PIA is free to evolve away from the DOM's object model to something
       perhaps lighter-weight and less restrictive.  
  <li> It becomes easier to ``wrap'' non-DOM data structures, since the
       wrapper doesn't have to look like a DOM tree.  In fact, it is not
       necessary to modify the wrapped object at all -- just provide a cursor
       for it.
</ul>

<h3>Getting there</h3>

<p> There are two distinct routes to a split model with an upgraded DOM:

<ol>
  <li> Upgrade the PIA's DOM implementation to the current standard, then
       upgrade Cursor and the DPS to eliminate direct use of the DOM's
       interfaces.
  <li> Upgrade Cursor and the DPS to be totally DOM-independent, then fix the
       DOM implementation. 
</ol>

<p> The second path is basically cleaner, but the first would get us to DOM
    compliance more quickly, and integrates better with the other near-term
    goal of an XML representation for Agents.

<h2>Language Improvements</h2>

<blockquote>

 <p> `When I use a word,' Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, `it
     means just what I choose it to mean -- neither more nor less.' 

 <p> `The question is,' said Alice, `whether you <em>can</em> make words mean
     so many different things.'  

 <p> `The question is,' said Humpty Dumpty, `which is to be master - - that's
     all.'  
  <p> -- <em>Lewis Carrol</em>
</blockquote>

<h3>XML compliance</h3>

<p> For better or for worse, XML has moved farther apart from HTML.  Its
    proponents would like to drag HTML along for the ride, and use strict XML
    for <em>everything</em> on the Web.  I don't necessarily hold with this
    view, but as long as the PIA has been touted as an XML-based system we
    have to go along at least part of the way, and make our language as
    strictly XML-compliant as we can.

<p> At this point there are really only two places where we differ from XML:

<ol>
  <li> Our use of namespaces diverges a great deal from XML's, to the point
       where an XML application that is aware of namespaces might not be able
       to deal with our <code>.xh</code> files.  On the other hand it might;
       XML doesn't appear to recognize namespaces in entity names.
  <li> Our language was designed with SGML attribute minimization in mind.
       The resulting constructs (e.g. ``<code>foo="foo"</code>'' are often
       particularly ugly in XML.
</ol>

<h3>Namespaces</h3>

<p> In order to accomodate XML namespaces, we may want to use  a different
    character as our namespace separator.  Dash, period, and underscore are
    available; period would seem to be the best substitute.  

<h3>Attributes</h3>

<p> SGML allows attributes to be minimized in two different ways:
<ol>
  <li> an attribute with no value specified evaluates to its name
  <li> by requiring that enumerated values be unique across all the attributes
       of an element, an enumerated value can be assigned to its proper
       attribute
</ol>

<p> HTML makes use only of the first but, as we will see below, we can take
    advantage of the second in writing a cleanup tagset.

<p> There are basically five ways to ``pretty-up'' attributes:

<ol>
  <li> Move the offending attributes into tag names.  In other words, use
       &lt;test.zero&gt; instead of &lt;test zero&gt;.
  <li> Turn them from attribute names to values.  For example, transform
       &lt;numeric sum&gt; into &lt;numeric op="sum"&gt;.
  <li> Give their value a useful meaning.
  <li> Move from two attributes, one of which is boolean, to two attributes
       with values, one of which is optional.  An example from the
       <em>old</em> language was &lt;read file=<em>filename</em>&gt;
       vs. &lt;read href=<em>url</em>&gt;.
  <li> Move data from attributes to sub-elements.  We did that when we moved
       from &lt;repeat list=<em>list</em>&gt; to
       &lt;repeat&gt;&lt;foreach&gt;<em>list</em>
       &lt;/foreach&gt;&lt;/repeat&gt;.  
</ol>

<p> Most likely, some combination of all of these will be required in order to
    redesign the language so that it is both fully XML-compliant and easily
    human-readable.

<h4>Implementation Note</h4>

<p> <code>GenericHandler</code> already has a method called
    <code>dispatch</code> that can handle the first three methods above:  it
    will recognize a keyword either as an attribute name, the value of a
    specified attribute, or a suffix to the tag name.
