<h1>PIA for LISPers</h1>

<p> The PIA is very LISP-like internally:

<ul>
  <li> Both operate on tree-structured data.
  <li> In both, the same representation is used for data and programs.
</ul>

<p> The main differences are:

<ul>
  <li> The default bindings simply copy elements and text from the input
       document to the output.  The effect is very much like the backquote
       operator in LISP.
  <li> All function bindings are explicit.  Unlike LISP, in which the standard
       functions are precompiled and always present, in the PIA the bindings
       (tagset) for processing a document is always specified, and more than
       one set of tag and entity bindings can be in effect.  This makes it
       easier to specify completely different sets of bindings for different
       purposes (for example, pretty-printing). 
  <li> In LISP, processing takes place at two times: in READ (when data
       structures are built and read macros interpreted) and in EVAL.  The PIA
       has an Input (corresponding roughly to READ), a Processor
       (corresponding to EVAL), and an Output (similar to PRINT) -- processing
       is more like structure copying than evaluation, and substantial amounts
       of processing can be done in the Output.
  <li> Rather than simply expanding a tree, the Processor copies from a
       tree traverser (the Input) to a tree constructor (the Output).  This
       lets it operate on documents that are too large to fit in memory.
  <li> The Processor can also be made to look like an Output, so pipelines can
       be constructed.  (This is mainly used in tool chains like SAX in which
       the parser expects to drive an application by calling a function on
       every node.)
</ul>
