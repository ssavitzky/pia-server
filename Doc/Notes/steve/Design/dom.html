<h3>The Two Great World Systems</h3>

<blockquote>
<dl>
  <dt> Linguistic side-note:
  <dd> In paleontology, ``cursorial'' refers to the hypothesis that dinosaurs
       evolved into birds by running after flying insects with their
       (feathered) forelimbs outstretched as catchers.  This contrasts with
       the ``arboreal'' hypothesis that wings evolved to improve dinosaurs'
       ability to jump out of trees.
  <dt> Historical side-note:
  <dd> <em>Dialog of the Two Great World Systems</em> was the title of
       Galileo's (rather one-sided) comparison of the Ptolemaic and Copernican
       representations of the universe.

<h4>Trees</h4>

<p> The DOM presently DOMinates the field of Java representations for XML
    documents (parse trees).  Essentially, it's the only game in town.
    Unfortunately it has some problems:

<ul>
  <li> Live NodeList's are notoriously hard to implement efficiently. 
  <li> DOM Level 2's Iterator interface is defined as throwing an exception
       when the structure it is iterating over is modified.
  <li> The obvious representation as doubly-linked trees has quite a lot of
       storage and processing overhead. 
  <li> There is simply no way to move a node from one document to another, or
       to have an isolated node that is not part of a document.
  <li> There is no representation for element or attribute definitions in the
       DocumentType interface, so a DTD cannot be completely represented. 
  <li> Information about quote characters, implied end tags (in HTML), and so
       on is lost.  It is impossible to reconstruct a document from its DOM
       representation.  
</ul>

<p> Also, there is no place in the DOM for the kind of metadata (e.g.,
    handlers) that the DPS needs in order to do its job.  This by itself is
    enough to require the PIA to have its own implementation of the DOM.

<h4>Cursors</h4>

<p> The DPS notion of a Cursor evolved out the (subsequently abandoned) DOM
    interface TreeIterator.  The basic idea is that a Cursor allows the DPS to
    <em>traverse</em> a DOM tree, or what <em>appears to be</em> a DOM tree,
    without actually looking at the DOM nodes themselves.

<p> Presently there is a lot of leakage between the DOM and the DPS, and the
    current version of Cursor actually <em>does</em> allow (and in fact
    require) access to the DOM node.  This can be fixed, however.

<p> The result would be a purely ``cursorial'' interface to documents,
    <em>completely</em> independent of the DOM's ``arboreal'' interfaces.

<h3>Benefits</h3>

A split model, DOM + Cursors, would have several advantages:

<ul>
  <li> By reducing the number of things in the PIA that actually depend on the
       DOM interfaces, it would be easier to transition the PIA from the old
       DOM interfaces it is using now to the current, official ones.
  <li> Any DOM could be ``dropped in'' by providing suitable cursors. 
  <li> The PIA can operate by side-stepping the DOM's interfaces rather than
       by abusing them, as it presently does.
  <li> The PIA is free to evolve away from the DOM's object model to something
       perhaps lighter-weight and less restrictive.  
  <li> It becomes easier to ``wrap'' non-DOM data structures, since the
       wrapper doesn't have to look like a DOM tree.  In fact, it is not
       necessary to modify the wrapped object at all -- just provide a cursor
       for it.
</ul>

<h3>Getting there</h3>

<p> There are two distinct routes to a split model with an upgraded DOM:

<ol>
  <li> Upgrade the PIA's DOM implementation to the current standard, then
       upgrade Cursor and the DPS to eliminate direct use of the DOM's
       interfaces.
  <li> Upgrade Cursor and the DPS to be totally DOM-independent, then fix the
       DOM implementation. 
</ol>

<p> The second path is basically cleaner, but the first would get us to DOM
    compliance more quickly, and integrates better with the other near-term
    goal of an XML representation for Agents.

<h2>Design Notes</h2>

<blockquote><em>
  This section was originally in
  <a href="../projects.html">../projects.html</a>.
</em></blockquote>

<p> Possible name: GLOM (Generic Lightweight Object Model).  Other
    possibilities include Dlite, DOC (Document Object Cursors), ...

<h3>Relationship to the DOM</h3>

<p> The problem is that once you start using the DOM, you're pretty-well stuck
    with it, including all its unsuitable characteristics: lack of DTD
    coverage, live nodelists, fragile iterators, doubly-linked trees, total
    inability to move nodes between documents, and so on.

<p> Our representation needs to be <em>compatible with</em> but <em>disjoint
    from</em> the DOM.  Our trees should have <em>both</em> a DOM interface
    (for compatibility with other tools) and our own; the DPS should use only
    our own interface.

<p> Insisting that parse trees be immutable fixes many of the DOM's problems.
    There are still some problems with entities, but we can gloss over that:
    if you're redefining entities you're by definition outside of the DOM.

<h3>Desirable Characteristics</h3>

<ul>
  <li> The interfaces seen by the DPS should be purely navigational: you never
       actually point to a DOM node, only navigate among them.  This gives
       <em>total</em> isolation from the implementation.  In other words we
       use <em>cursors</em>.

  <li> For putting things into containers, we will want wrappers (handles?)
       and wrapper factories.  These will go along with the cursors and
       <em>their</em> factories.  They will basically be cursors without
       navigation.  The usual tree nodes, of course, will not need wrappers. 

  <li> Active objects like tagsets, namespaces, and agents might be DOM nodes
       underneath, but we ignore that and use only their interfaces.  They can
       be constructed either declaratively (by reading) or procedurally (by
       tree manipulation).
</ul>

<p> Bascally what we're doing is splitting up the DOM interfaces into two
    pieces: the informational and the navigational.  We want to be able to get
    at the attributes, content/value/children, and text of our nodes without
    worrying about the connections among them.

<p> Of course, in addition to the DOM attributes, we also want to get at the
    DPS attributes of our objects: action, syntax, key (for sorting and
    extraction), etc.

<h3><a name="where">Where Things Go</a></h3>

<p> There are three possibilities:

<ol>
  <li> Move the ActiveNode interfaces to <code>org.risource.dom.active</code>,
       and the implementations to <code>org.risource.dom.tree</code>.  Move
       <code>Cursor</code> and related stuff to, perhaps,
       <code>org.risource.dom.cursor</code>. Blow away
       <code>org.risource.dps.active</code> or use it for purely DPS-specific
       stuff (which might be hard to find).  It's rather hard to justify
       having the ActiveNode interfaces under the DOM, but it does mean that
       <code>org.risource.dom</code> and its sub-directories constitute a
       completely stand-alone implementation of the DOM.
  <li> Move the implementations to <code>org.risource.dps.tree</code>.  Blow
       away <code>org.risource.dom</code> or use it for utilities that use
       only the <code>org.w3c.dom</code> interfaces.  This leaves
       <code>org.risource.dps</code> and its sub-packages as a stand-alone
       document processor.  If the DOM and DPS go their separate ways, nobody
       will notice. 
  <li> Move the implementations to <code>org.risource.dom.tree</code> but
       leave the ActiveNode interfaces in
       <code>org.risource.dps.active</code>.  In this case, neither
       <code>org.risource.dom</code> nor <code>org.risource.dps</code> can
       stand alone, but minimal damage is done to the existing directory
       structure (<code>tree</code> is added, but nothing goes away).  The way
       is still open to a totally DOM-free version of the DPS.
</ol>

<p> <strong>We have taken the middle way.</strong>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

<p> There are basically three ways to proceed:

<ol>
  <li> Blow away the old DOM interfaces in org.risource.dom, put the new
       interfaces in place, move the implementation to org.risource.dom.tree,
       and basically go to completion in one step.  This leaves the working
       copy of the PIA out of commission for the longest time.
  <li> Develop new working copies of the mixed (ActiveNode) interfaces and
       their implementation.  Then switch the DPS over, using the mixed
       interfaces until we can shift it from ``arboreal'' to purely
       ``cursorial'' form.  This is the fastest route to DOM compliance.
  <li> Switch the DPS over to being purely cursorial.  <em>Then</em> drop in
       the new ActiveNode implementation.
</ol>

<p> The nice thing about the middle path is that it is the most incremental
    and least disruptive.  It proceeds very quickly to a compliant DOM
    implementation, then merges it in.  It does mean several different
    disruptions, but at least they would be fairly short ones.  It also means
    that things can go under source control before work is complete.

<p> During the transition, the <code>ActiveNode</code> interfaces will
    continue to be used in the DPS.  Afterward, they will be used only in the
    cursor implementations.
