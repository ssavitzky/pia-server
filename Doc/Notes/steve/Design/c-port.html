<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> This document describes a design for a C or C++ port of the PIA.  The
    design goals are:

<ol>
  <li> Integrate the PIA with existing open-source applications.
  <li> Use as much existing open source code as possible.
  <li> Port as much as possible of the DPS (document-processing system).
  <li> Support a large fraction of the PIA server's functionality, but not
       necessarily all of it. 
</ol>

<h2>Available Resources</h2>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.jclark.com/">James Clark</a>'s SP parser and its
       derivatives.  It's written in C++ and has an event-oriented interface.
       SP is under a BSD-type license. 
  <li> <a href="http://www.jclark.com/">James Clark</a>'s Jade, a C++
       implementation of the DSSSL style-sheet language for SGML.  Jade is
       also under a BSD-type license, and includes SP as a subset.
  <li> <a href="http://www.jclark.com/">James Clark</a>also has an XML parser
       called Expat written in C.  Expat is under the <a
       href="http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/">MPL</a>.  Note that Expat has a
       callback for passing references to unparsed external entities to the
       application, and also is able to pass <em>all</em> entity references to
       the application. 
  <li> The <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> web server, which is
       under a BSD-type license.
</ul>


<h2>Design Sketch</h2>

<p> There are two plausible approaches:

<ol>
  <li> Implement the DPS using Jade.  This involves writing the bulk of the
       DPS in DSSSL, which is basically an extension of Scheme.  This is
       likely to be unfamiliar territory for C programmers, and may result in
       an inefficient implementation.  Also, Jade is rather bulky, weighing in
       at over 6MB of source code.  About half of that is SP.
  <li> Implement the DPS directly in C or C++ using Expat as the parser.
       This can be done quite efficiently if we give up the sub-elements of
       &lt;extract&gt; that modify structure, somewhat less efficiently if we
       don't.  If an HTML parser is needed, it can be implemented using
       Expat's tokenizer as a base. 
</ol>

<p> In view of Jade's size and complexity, it seems best to implement the DPS
    in C starting with Expat.  The design sketch follows:

<h3>Storage Format</h3>

<p> What I have in mind is an implementation that stores trees, not as
    individual nodes connected by pointers, but as flattened arrays of
    characters.  Each node would have a binary header and trailer that
    includes the length of its contents.  The only place pointers would be
    necessary would be in namespaces.

<p> The advantages of a flattened tree are that, although navigation is nearly
    as fast as a linked tree, depth-first traversal is actually faster, and
    storage-management is trivial.  In addition, by padding strings to some
    reasonable length (8 bytes comes to mind), one could ensure that numeric
    fields always start on word boundaries; this would also allow the
    occasional pointer for things like handlers.

<p> Note that storage management for a flat, compact array of what amount to
    strings is particularly simple, although keeping the array compact does
    involve copying.  In the most common case, where input is from events and
    output is to a stream, holes will only occur when a variable is set inside
    of something being expanded.

<p> Some kind of interleaving scheme (with "skip" spans as well as "content"
    spans) would allow variables to be written into at the same time as
    intermediate (processed content) parse trees.  (Variables would end up as
    something akin to comment nodes.)  This is only an issue, of course, when
    something like a repeat or extract is embedded in something else, e.g. a
    set, that constructs a nodelist.

<p> It may be best, though, to do the initial implementation with ordinary
    nodes to avoid unnecessary complexity.

<p> Note also that in embedded applications it will often be possible to
    pre-parse files, and even embed them in the server in the form of
    initialized C data structures.  Constructing the C can be done using a
    tagset.  In particular, we can reasonably expect that <em>tagsets</em>
    will be preloaded in this way.

<h3>Apache Module Interface</h3>

<p> Apache includes a ``transaction-oriented'' storage-allocation model: all
    storage associated with a transaction is kept together, and returned when
    the transaction is completed.  This makes things very simple.

<p> One problem with Apache is that documents are served out of multiple,
    single-threaded processes.  This makes it difficult to share data at the
    ``Agent'' or ``PIA'' (global) level.  If this is necessary we could make
    yet another process, running as a kind of ``nano-PIA'' server, to manage
    the shared entities.  (This is similar to what <code>mod_java</code> does,
    for example.)  Alternatively we could use the file system for shared data,
    but there are locking issues involved in that approach.

<p> Note that the ``flattened tree'' binary format is almost ideal for
    communicating with the ``nano-PIA'' entity server. 

<h2>Implementation Plan</h2>

<ol>
  <li> Incorporate <code>expat</code> into the tree (as
       <code>src/c/com/jclark/expat</code>) and build it.
  <li> Design data structures and interfaces for a minimal set of DPS
       components: Node, NodeList, Input, Output, Processor, Context,
       Namespace, and a few others.  Use <code>expat</code> as a style guide. 
  <li> Write a pair of drivers: a  C main program equivalent to
       <code>process</code>, and another that works as a CGI.  Implement a
       simple <code>mod_pia</code> if it's easy.
  <li> Implement a skeleton version of Processor that simply copies input to
       output. 
  <li> Implement those handlers that can operate in pass-through mode without
       constructing an intermediate parse tree.  These include
       <code>if</code>, <code>hide</code>, and <code>protect</code>.
  <li> Implement the linked-list parse-tree representation.
  <li> Implement Processor, building parse trees for active nodes that can't
       be run in pass-through mode.
  <li> Implement the rest of the handlers.  There are about 40 top-level
       handler classes in the DPS, and about twice that many sub-handlers.  A
       few will be unnecessary; others can easily be postponed.
  <li> Implement the flat-file parse-tree representation.  This may fall out
       of what Mark is doing on the storage system.
  <li> Implement a simple shared-variable server for use with
       <code>mod_pia</code> in Apache.
</ol>
