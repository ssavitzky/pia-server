<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> This document describes a design for a C or C++ port of the PIA.  The
    design goals are:

<ol>
  <li> Integrate the PIA with existing open-source applications.
  <li> Use as much existing open source code as possible.
  <li> Port as much as possible of the DPS (document-processing system).
  <li> Support a large fraction of the PIA server's functionality, but not
       necessarily all of it. 
</ol>

<h2>Available Resources</h2>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="http://www.jclark.com/">James Clark</a>'s SP parser and its
       derivatives.  It's written in C++ and has an event-oriented interface.
       Clark also has an XML parser called Expat.
  <li> <a href="http://www.jclark.com/">James Clark</a>'s Jade, a C++
       implementation of the DSSSL style-sheet language for SGML.
  <li> The <a href="http://www.apache.org/">Apache</a> web server.
</ul>


<h2>Alternative Designs</h2>

<p> There are two plausible approaches:

<ol>
  <li> Implement the DPS using Jade.  This involves writing the bulk of the
       DPS in DSSSL, which is basically an extension of Scheme.  This is
       likely to be unfamiliar territory for C programmers, and may result in
       an inefficient implementation.
  <li> Implement the DPS directly in C or C++.  This can be done quite
       efficiently if we give up the sub-elements of &lt;extract&gt; that
       modify structure.
</ol>

<h3>Jade</h3>


<h3>Direct Implementation</h3>

<p> What I have in mind is an implementation that stores trees, not as
    individual nodes connected by pointers, but as flattened arrays of
    characters.  Each node would have a binary header and trailer that include
    the length of its contents.  The only place pointers would be used would
    be in namespaces.

<p> The advantages of a flattened tree are that, although navigation is nearly
    as fast as a linked tree, depth-first traversal is actually faster, and
    storage-management is trivial.  In addition, by padding strings to some
    reasonable length (8 bytes comes to mind), one could ensure that numeric
    fields always start on word boundaries, and would also allow the
    occasional pointer for things like handlers.

<p> Some kind of interleaving scheme (with "skip" spans as well as "content"
    spans) would allow variables to be written into as well as intermediate
    (processed content) parse trees.
