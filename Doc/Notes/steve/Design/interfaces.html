  <p> This document discusses the PIA's architecture, the interfaces (API's)
      that it supports, and ways of integrating the PIA with other web servers
      and into other web applications in such a way to preserve cross-platform
      application portability.
  </p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> The PIA architecture has three main components (also referred to below as
    ``features''): 
</p>

<ol>
  <li> <strong><code>dps</code></strong> -- the Document Processing System
       that implements the tag language.  By itself, the DPS essentially
       provides a simple but complete ``macro language'' for XML and HTML web
       pages. 
  </li>
  <li> <strong><code>site</code></strong> -- the site structure package.  This
       provides a simple, robust, versatile, and OS-independent way of
       structuring the files and directories that comprise a web application.
  </li>
  <li> <strong><code>agents</code></strong> -- PIA agents provide the ability
       to operate (using the DPS) on web requests and documents as they
       pass through a PIA-based proxy server.  It is worth noting that most
       PIA applications will not require agents to operate on proxied
       transactions. 
  </li>
</ol>

<p> There are also four different degrees to which the PIA or its components
    may be integrated with a web server such as Apache:
</p>

<ol>
  <li> <strong>Not at all</strong> -- the PIA functions as a stand-alone
       web server.  
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Attached Server</strong> -- the main web server passes (some
       subset of) its requests off to the PIA.  This is the standard interface
       for servlet engines and for server-side scripting engines that need to
       share state among requests.  Note that many, if not all, attached
       servers can also run stand-alone.
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Fully Integrated</strong> -- the PIA components run inside the
       main server's memory image.  In a multi-process, single-threaded server
       like Apache 1.x this makes it difficult (not <em>necessarily</em>
       impossible) to share state among requests.
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Interfaces</h2>

<p> The following table lists some interfaces which it is plausible that the
    PIA might support:

<h2>PIA and Apache</h2>

<p> There are two main paths to a ``full-featured'' PIA integrated with Apache:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> <strong><code>mod_pia</code></strong> -- a full-featured PIA
       implemented as a set of standard, C, Apache modules.  It should
       <em>not</em> be necessary to implement a stand-alone PIA server in C. 
  </li>
  <li> <strong>AJP</strong> -- this is the interface used between a web server
       and a subsidiary server-like engine.  It keeps the present PIA
       essentially intact, and would be more efficient and better-integrated
       than the present <code>mod_proxy</code>-based scheme.  Some
       investigation is required, mainly to see whether proxying (and hence
       agents) can be supported through AJP. 
  </li>
</ol>

<p> Several intermediate or alternative structures are possible:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <strong>Servlet</strong> -- the servlet interface supports every
       feature of the PIA except agents operating on proxied transactions.
       With the aid of <code>mod_rewrite</code> it might even be possible to
       support those as well.
  </li>
  <li> <strong><code>mod_site</code> + AJP</strong> -- this puts processing
       into a separate server, but allows Apache to serve static HTML pages
       directly. 
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Tomcat Servlet</strong> -- using Tomcat's additional hooks, it
       should be possible to implement agents.  As with AJP, the only question
       is whether the servlet engine can also be used as a proxy.
  </li>
  <li> <strong><code>mod_perl</code></strong> -- a PERL implementation of the
       PIA would allow a full-featured PIA to run as part of Apache and
       interoperate cleanly with existing <code>mod_perl</code>-based web
       applications.  
  </li>
</ul>

<hr />
<h2>DPS outside the PIA</h2>

<p> It is likely that the DPS will be useful outside of the PIA.  Since the
    existing code will soon support all of the major Java interfaces (DOM,
    SAX, Servlet) used in XML applications this use should be encouraged, and
    may eventually lead to the PIA's tag language becoming a standard, either
    as an alternative or (less likely) an extension to XSLT.
</p>


<hr />
<h2>Alternative Implementations</h2>

<p> No effort should be put into alternative implementations (except for C, of
    course) at this time, but if some outside developer wants to do one they
    should be encouraged.
</p>

<dl>
  <dt> <strong>C</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd> The CPIA effort is, of course, already in progress.
  </dd>

  <dt> <strong>C++</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd> A C++ implementation would be a straightforward translation of the Java
       implementation, made simpler by the fact that C++ versions of the SAX
       and DOM API's already exist. 
  </dd>

  <dt> <strong>PERL</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd> This is the most attractive alternative implementation, because
       <code>mod_perl</code> is very popular and because most of the machinery
       required is already present in the form of PERL modules. 
  </dd>

  <dt> <strong>Python</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd> A Python implementation would probably be roughly as easy as a PERL
       one; Python has very good XML support, including a DOM implementation. 
  </dd>

  <dt> <strong>XSP</strong> (Cocoon 2)
  </dt>
  <dd> An implementation of the DPS as an XSP ``<em>taglib</em>'' (tag
       library) is feasible; it would provide a sort of ``universal taglib''
       for Cocoon. 
  </dd>

  <dt> <strong>DPS Compiler</strong>
  </dt>
  <dd> A set of DPS tags could (fairly easily) be written that translate the
       DPS tags into subroutines or classes in some existing programming
       language.  This raises the intriguing possibility of a PIA
       implementation written entirely ``in itself.''  Such an implementation
       would be both <em>extremely</em> portable and highly efficient.
  </dd>

  <dt> <strong></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd> 
  </dd>

  <dt> <strong></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd> 
  </dd>

  <dt> <strong></strong>
  </dt>
  <dd> 
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<p> What follows is the implementation roadmap for the PIA's interfaces:
</p>

<ol>
  <li> Implement the Java interfaces (Servlet, DOM, SAX, in that order).  Even
       though these do not directly lead to a full-featured PIA integrated
       with Apache, they are very simple and we have already committed to
       doing them.  They will give the PIA the highest possible level of
       interoperability with existing XML applications with minimal effort.
       In addition, the Servlet interface will provide a fallback position,
       integrating the PIA's <code>dps</code> and <code>site</code> packages
       with <em>any</em> servlet-based web server.
  </li>
  <li> Implement, or at least investigate, AJP.  This would provide a PIA
       implementation <em>fully</em> integrated with Apache and with all the
       other web servers that support AJP.  It's also possible that code taken
       from Tomcat's front end could greatly simplify and clean up the PIA's
       front-end code in <code>org.risource.pia</code> and
       <code>org.risource.content</code>.
  </li>
  <li> Implement <code>mod_pia</code>; the C port should be ready at about
       this time.  
  </li>
  <li> Cleanup.  Based on experiences with <code>mod_pia</code> and the Java
       interfaces, it should be possible to do a <em>major</em> cleanup and
       simplification of the PIA's Java implementation.  This would include
       eliminating redundant classes and interfaces, lazy expansion of tag
       content, and major overhaul of the <code>org.risource.pia</code>
       package.
  </li>
</ol>
