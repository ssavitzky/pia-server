<h1>Some Notes on Tagset Design</h1>

<h2>On the Naming of Tags</h2>

<p> This section contains thoughts on picking good tag names for your tagset. 
</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<p> Tags that perform actions should, generally speaking, have verbs or verb
    phrases as their names.  There should be enough information in the tag
    name for a reader (who speaks the same language as the writer!) to figure
    out what a tag does.
</p>


<p> For example, 
</p>

<ul>
  <li> <code>&lt;send-mail&gt;</code>, not <code>&lt;mail&gt;</code> (what do
       we do with this mail?) or <code>&lt;send&gt;</code> (send how?).
       <code>&lt;send&gt;</code> might be OK with attributes or sub-elements
       that make its meaning more clear.
  </li>
  <li> <code>&lt;add&gt;</code> rather than <code>&lt;sum&gt;</code> (which
       might just be <em>identifying</em> the sum rather than
       <em>computing</em> it).  Another alternative would be
       <code>&lt;compute-sum&gt;</code> or even
       <code>&lt;compute-total&gt;</code>, depending on usage.

       <blockquote><em>
         Useless historical note:  in the FORTRAN programming language,
         comments are identified by a ``<code>C</code>'' in column 1 of a
         card (line, to you youngsters).  I knew someone who always wrote
         comments to begin with a word that started with C, so as not to waste
         any space.  <code>COMPUTE</code> was very useful, as was
         <code>COMPARE</code>. 
       </em></blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Structure and Formatting</h3>

<p> Another good convention is for structural elements to have tag names that
    are nouns.  In HTML, the structural tag names are <em>abbreviations</em>
    of nouns, which works only if the DTD is widely known and understood.
    It's almost always acceptable to leech off of HTML and borrow its tag
    names; the DOCBOOK DTD is another good source.
</p>

<p> Similarly, <em>formatting</em> elements should have names that are
    adjectives.  For example, <code>&lt;small&gt;</code> and
    <code>&lt;big&gt;</code> in HTML.  You might add tags like
    <code>&lt;red&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;blue&gt;</code>.  Such tags can be
    particularly useful, not in your documents, but in your tag definitions --
    in that context you <em>want</em> to put in formatting details.
</p>


<h3>Data Structures</h3>

<p> Another popular naming convention, popular for tags that represent data
    structures or object classes, is to use a capitalized name for the
    structure and lowercase names for the components (fields) of that
    structure.  This matches the Java and C++ naming conventions.  If there is
    an underlying declaration in a different language, the names should
    match.  Attributes can be used for fields with primitive (integer, string,
    etc.) values.
</p>

<p> Within the PIA's tagsets, we have tended to use uppercase names for tags
    that represent structured data that is not normally formatted as XML.  For
    example, <code>&lt;DOCUMENT&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;QUERY&gt;</code>,
    <code>&lt;HEADERS&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;URL&gt;</code>.  Sub-elements
    of these tags define the components, but when the element is actually
    output to the browser, the entire element is replaced with a piece of
    untagged text.    
</p>

<blockquote> <em>One that we missed was <code>&lt;date&gt;</code> -- it too
  should have been uppercase.  The implementation is spotty, as well.</em>
</blockquote>


<h3>Passing Parameters</h3>

<p> There are three main ways of getting parameters into a defined element:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> <strong>Attributes.</strong>  This is by far the cleanest method,
       but suffers from the restriction that you can't easily <em>compute</em>
       the value of a parameter.  Attributes are easily accessed using the
       <code>attributes:</code> namespace.  A major advantage of using
       attributes is that they are easily documented using
       <code>&lt;define&nbsp;attribute="<em>name</em>"&gt;</code>. 
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Variables.</strong>  Variables set outside the defined element
       are accessible from inside its definition.  Unfortunately there is no
       good way to <em>document</em> these so-called ``free'' variables --
       there should be. 
  </li>
  <li> <strong>Sub-elements.</strong> Putting parameters into sub-elements is
       the ``classical'' XML solution, and has the major advantage that you
       can put arbitrary computations inside the sub-elements.  There are a
       few caveats:
       
       <ol>
	 <li> Be careful what you name your sub-elements -- the names should
	      not conflict with existing active tags.
	 </li>
	 <li> If your parent element has <code>syntax="quoted"</code> you will
	      have to explicitly expand sub-elements; the expansion will
	      happen in the namespace of the definition.  Be careful what
	      local variables you define in that case!
	 </li>
	 <li> Accessing the value is a little awkward:  you need to use
	      something like:
	      <pre>&lt;extract&gt;&lt;from&gt;&amp;content;&lt;/from&gt;
	 <em>subelement</em> &lt;content/&gt;
&lt;extract&gt;	      
	      </pre>
	 </li>
       </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<p> In the near future it will be possible to define an element so that you
    can access both sub-elements and attributes in the same namespace.
</p>

<h2>Entities and Variables</h2>

<h3>Tagset Entities</h3>

<p> There are several good uses for entities defined in the tagset:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> As abbreviations.  This is the most obvious one:  for example, we
       define <code>&amp;risource.org;</code> to expand into our multi-color,
       multi-font logo (<a href="http://www.RiSource.org/"
            ><font color="#c40026" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
                   >Ri</font><font color="black"
	                           face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
                   ><i>Source.org</i></font></a>) linked to the web site:
       <pre>
&lt;define entity="RiSource.org">
  &lt;value>&lt;a href="http://www.RiSource.org/"
            >&lt;font color="#c40026" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
                   >Ri&lt;/font>&lt;font color="black"
	                           face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"
                   >&lt;i>Source.org&lt;/i>&lt;/font>&lt;/a>
  &lt;/value>
&lt;/define>
</pre>
       This kind of abbreviation is especially useful for tricky typography,
       links, logos, and so on; it's much simpler than cut-and-paste,
       especially when you want to change something.  
  </li>

  <li> Entities can also be used in attributes, which makes their use for
       things like URL's a natural as well.
  </li>

  <li> As default formatting parameters.  These are easily overridden in the
       document being processed, if exceptions have to be made.  Good examples
       include default sizes and colors.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Variables</h3>

<p> In the PIA, <em>variables</em> (which can be created or changed on-the-fly
    in a document) have the syntax of SGML <em>entities</em>, which cannot.
    Also, as in most programming languages, each PIA variable has a
    <em>scope</em>, or <em>namespace</em>, in which it is defined, and this
    scope is designated by a ``namespace prefix'' separated from the name
    proper with a colon.
</p>

<p> Strictly speaking, neither of these conventions is allowed in XML.  Hence,
    the PIA provides an alternative mechanism for accessing variables, using
    the <code>&lt;get&gt;</code> element.  Unfortunately, you can't put
    <code>&amp;get&gt;</code> into an attribute value -- you have to construct
    the entire element using a <code>&lt;make&gt;</code> tag:
</p>

<pre>
    &lt;make name="a">
	&lt;let name="href">&lt;get name="DOC:name"/>#foo&lt;let&gt;
	contents of the constructed link.
    &lt;/make>
</pre>

<p> It's important to realize that these techniques are only necessary if you
    want to process PIA files with some other XML tools -- the PIA can handle
    its peculiar entity/variable syntax with no problems. 
</p>

<p> At some point we will probably make the variable delimiters
    (<code>&amp;</code> and <code>;</code>) and the namespace/scope delimiter
    (<code>:</code>) parameters of the tagset, so that you can build XML files
    that can be processed without complaint by namespace-aware applications.
    This will require reparsing text, but it may be worth the performance hit.
</p>

<h2>Interoperability Hints</h2>

<h3>Document Structure</h3>

<p> An SGML (and by extension, XML) document is required to have a single
    root element, which is named in the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE <em>root</em>
    ...</code> declaration.  An XML document, moreover, is required to start
    with an XML declaration (which purists insist is not a processing
    instruction even though it has the syntax of one).  All entities have to
    be declared in the DTD.
</p>

<p> PIA documents, in general, have none of these.  This makes them, formally,
    ``parsed external entities'' rather than XML documents.  The distinction
    is totally irrelevant in the PIA, but will probably need to be taken into
    account when you try to process or edit a PIA document using third-party
    XML tools.
</p>


<hr />
<h2>Markup Hints</h2>

<h3>Logical, not physical, markup</h3>

<p> <em>Never</em> use ``physical'' markup as a substitute for structure.  For
    example, a bibliographic entry should look something like:
</p>

<pre>  &lt;book&gt; &lt;title&gt;Real-Time Microprocessor Systems&lt;/title&gt;
         &lt;author&gt;Savitzky, Stephen&lt;/author&gt;
         &lt;date&gt;1985&lt;/date&gt;
         &lt;publisher&gt;Van Nostrand Reinhold&lt;/publisher&gt;
         &lt;city&gt;New York&lt;/city&gt;
  &lt;/book&gt;
</pre>

<p> ... and not the more traditional-looking, pure HTML version,
</p>

<pre>  &lt;p&gt; Savitzky, Stephen
      &lt;i&gt;Real-Time Microprocessor Systems.&lt;/i&gt;
      New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1985.
  &lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<p> which is what you might get out of a WYSIWYG word processing program.
    Note that the first version is much easier to extract information from --
    it's exactly what you need for building a database, for example, or for
    sorting a list of books by date or title.  Also note that the order of
    sub-elements in the XML file doesn't have to be the same as the order in
    which things are eventually presented.
</p>

<p> Remember, this is XML:  you can make up tags, and use a tagset to format
    them any way you want. 
</p>


<h3>Define tags for page components</h3>

<p> It's always a good idea to define structural elements like
    <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> rather than
    code up some elaborate table in an attempt to make your page look good.
    This is a good idea even if your page is basically HTML -- it's done
    throughout the PIA applications.
