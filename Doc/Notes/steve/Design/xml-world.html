<p> The goal here is to represent as many PIA internal objects as possible in
    XML.  This is comparatively easy:  we have an interface, ActiveElement,
    that satisfies both DOM and DPS requirements, and an implementation for it
    (currently called <code>ParseTreeGeneric</code>) that is easy to
    subclass.  (In a previous implementation phase, GenericAgent actually
    <em>did</em> descend from the class that implemented Elements.)

<p> The parser is already capable of building elements with classes other than
    the default ParseTreeElement, but this capability has not been tested and
    more work needs to be done.

<p> There are two main ways to represent PIA objects as XML: make them
    subclasses of an existing ActiveElement implementation, or make them
    independent implementations.  It is significantly easier to put them into
    existing structures if they inherit from the same base class as our
    existing parse trees, and it simplifies the implementation as well.

<p> A third technique exists: to <em>wrap</em> the PIA objects.  This is
    presently being done with Agent (using NamespaceWrap), but although it
    makes it possible to put the wrapped objects into an XML document, it
    means that you have to build a separate handler to do the construction.

<h3>Benefits</h3>

<p> Some of the benefits that would result from an XML representation are:

<ul>
  <li> When something is represented as XML, i.e. as a parse tree, it becomes
       much easier to manipulate it using our XXML tag language.
  <li> XML objects are more efficient to construct.  Currently, in order to
       initialize something like a tagset, we have to:
       <ul>
	 <li> parse a document containing &lt;define&gt; tags
	 <li> call on the <code>defineHandler</code> to interpret those tags
	 <li> initialize the object by calling specialized methods known only
	      to <code>defineHandler</code>
       </ul>
       <p> An XML representation would eliminate all but the first step:
	   constructing the parse tree would <em>in itself</em> construct the
	   object.
  <li> XML objects can be written out in a form that can be read back in.
       Currently agents, tagsets and namespaces can't easily be converted to
       an external form, because they don't map directly into XML. 
  <li> XML-represented objects can easily be manipulated by other tools.
</ul>

<h3>Targets</h3>

<p> Some of the objects that could be represented in XML (in approximate order
    of increasing complexity of implementation):

<dl>
  <dt> Tagsets and Namespaces
  <dd> Actually, BasicTagset and BasicNamespace <em>already</em> inherit from
       ParseTreeGeneric.  The only difficulty is that there is no set of
       handlers to construct them directly from XML documents, and writing
       them out doesn't produce something that could be read back in because
       the implementation is incomplete.  The &lt;define&gt; tag imposes an
       extra layer of indirection.
  <dt> Agents
  <dd> Presently these are simply wrapped as namespaces; it might work better
       if some components (<code>name</code>, <code>path</code>, and the
       directories, for example) were attributes.  Not essential, though.
       There is a complexity for agents: if you don't know <em>both</em> the
       home and user directories at initialization time, you don't know where
       to look for the XML metadata.
  <dt> Match Criteria
  <dd> Presently an agent's criteria are initialized by means of a rather
       simpleminded conversion from strings.  It would be easier if
       they were real XML.
  <dt> Transactions
  <dd> There's a lot of complexity in Transaction and its subclasses that
       might go away if they were XML.  There would be the further advantage
       that many of the computations that need to be done on them could be
       done via XXML rather than Java.  It's not <em>entirely</em> clear that
       this would be a good idea, however.
  <dt> Features 
  <dd> The little objects that compute transaction features could
       <em>also</em> be XML code, but this is probably <em>not</em> a good
       idea, since it would be very inefficient.  It's not unreasonable to
       surface the features themselves as attributes, however.
</dl>

<p> Note that this list is <em>not</em> in order of implementation priority;
    it's not clear whether to do tagsets or agents first. 

<h3>Advanced: XML serialization of arbitrary objects</h3>

<p> There's actually a straightforward way to represent <em>any</em> Java
    object as an XML element:

<ul>
  <li> Represent all numeric, boolean, and String instance variables as
       attributes. 
  <li> Represent all other instance variables as sub-elements. 
  <li> Use the class name as the tagname.
</ul>

<p> It wouldn't surprise me much if there were already code available to do
    this.  It has some problems:  since it doesn't map easily into the DOM,
    one can't directly manipulate such an object from XXML code.  Also,
    without some additional metadata, linked structures get <em>very</em> ugly
    and don't map into the most obvious XML representation.

<h2>Design Notes</h2>

<blockquote><em>
  This section was originally in
  <a href="../projects.html">../projects.html</a>.
</em></blockquote>

<p> Agents really want to be elements, with sub-elements for hooks and
    criteria.  (They should really be a subclass of Tagset, so that
    entities could be used for for ``options'' and element handlers for
    actions.)  Similarly, tagsets want to be purely declarative, probably
    using the XML schema tags.

<p> Aside: Tagset should be a subclass of Namespace.  There's actually an
    ambiguity here: building a Tagset should normally just be a matter of
    loading it.  This implies a shift from the imperative (&lt;define&gt;,
    &lt;set&gt;) to the declarative (&lt;element&gt;, &lt;entity&gt;).

<p> In order to pull this off, handlers need the ability to specify the
    class of the element being constructed.  <strong>But they already have
    this!</strong>  The relevant method is <code>Syntax.createElement</code>.

<p> Elements are created <em>by the parser</em>, so that one can just suck an
    object in and use it.  The handler already knows, of course, whether to
    wait until the whole element is present, but we do need to add the parser
    hooks required to actually build the element even if we're streaming.  The
    class name wants to be in a field in the handler.

<p> There are some subtleties involved: even if one is processing on the fly,
    the object gets built ``offline'' as a parse tree, then passed as a whole.
    That is, of course, more efficient than executing definitions every time a
    document is processed.  It requires a distinction between declarations and
    actions, though.  All the construction is done at parse time using the
    addChild operation in the node under construction.  All the parser needs
    is a flag to say whether to build or pass.  It also needs to call the
    new object's initializer when the end tag is seen.

<p> Clearly, if we want to use conditionals, repeats, or other computation to
    construct the object at run-time, we need to use actions instead.  The
    pure declarative mode only works with quoted elements.  We can of course
    mix them, and build a tree on the output after processing.  There is a
    further point: entities in the <em>attributes</em> have to be expanded by
    the handler.  (They should be anyway -- it's more efficient.  A proper DOM
    implementation with <code>getValue</code> would do this automagically.)

<p> There are advantages to the declarative approach, though.  Apart from
    speed, there's reflection as well: an XML schema document would be trivial
    to analyze and transform.  Clearly it's trivial for a tagset (in our
    current scheme) to output a purely declarative schema, so a transition
    would be simple.  But this isn't really necessary: just construct the
    object as usual, and convert it to a string!

<p> Once we get to this point, a lot of things can be simplified:

<ul>
  <li> Initialization is just reading an <code>agent.xml</code> file with the
       <code>agent</code> tagset.  <code>initialize.xh</code> goes away except
       for agents that really need to execute code on startup.  Even then, an
       intialization <em>entity</em> should do most of the work.
  <li> Checkpointing is just writing.
  <li> Tagsets, inserts, initialization, etc. can be stored in an agent's
       entities. 
  <li> If read-write entities work, making agents persistant is
       <em>trivial</em>.  (This suggests that persistant entities need a
       search path, so that we can intialize from the home directory and write
       to the user directory.)
  <li> With a few more filename- and url-manipulating primitives, most of the
       hairy path stuff can also be written in tags.
  <li> It should be easy to make &lt;define&gt; simply construct objects and
       stuff them into the appropriate tagsets and namespaces using
       &lt;set&gt; or &lt;extract&gt;.
</ul>

<p> Similarly, transactions and their content should be represented as
    specialized DOM nodes.  It's almost orthogonal, except that it so nicely
    unifies actions (with their various ways of handling content) and
    transactions, entities with machines, and so on.

<p> We may continue to need ways of initializing agents (especially)
    using initialize.xh, at least as a bootstrapping mechanism.  So the
    installer needs to check.

<h2>Implementation Notes</h2>

<h3>Entity Output</h3>

<p> There's a problem: how do things like Entity nodes print?

<p> The answer is that it really depends on their parent.  If it's a DOCTYPE
    (declaration) node, then the Entity should get output as a declaration.
    If it's an Element (e.g. &lt;NAMESPACE&gt;), then the Entity should get
    output as an &lt;ENTITY&gt; element.

<p> At the moment it's all kind of moot: we want XML representations, and we
    don't parse doctypes properly.


<h3>Agent and Entity Input</h3>

<p> When an Entity is read in, it's really the parent (e.g. the Agent or
    Tagset) that should determine what to do with it, in the
    <code>append</code> method.  There's a major complication in the fact that
    the parser will append the entity before its contents are seen, if a tree
    is being constructed.  One would be tempted to do the construction with an
    Output, except that has the same problem!

<p> The right thing is to <em>initialize</em> the new object after reading
    it.  This could actually be done by putting a processing instruction at
    the end of the content!  It's not a problem for Tagset or Namespace
    because the bindings just go right into the table, and nothing has to be
    done to their content after that.  Agents <em>have</em> to be
    initialized. 

<p>&nbsp;

<p> There's another complication: the Agent's tagset <em>must</em> be
    available while the Agent is being read in.  Passing it as an attribute or
    the first entity wouldn't work, because the node under construction
    doesn't know about the parser!  Another alternative is to update all the
    handlers when the Agent is initialized.  That would be slow.

<p> One correct solution is to put the tagset's filename into the DOCTYPE
    (where it belongs anyway) or into a processing instruction (targeted at
    the parser).  Another is to separate construction from parsing.

<p>&nbsp;

<p> Ideally one would like to be able to read an &lt;ENTITY&gt; element, for
    example, and construct a <code>TreeEntity</code> node.  The problem is
    that the parser has called the Handler's <code>createElement</code> method
    and is really expecting an Element back.  It would be better if it set the
    tagname variable first (so that the end tag has something to match), but
    then left the node alone to be whatever type got returned.  The only
    alternative would be to make almost everything a <code>TreeGeneric</code>,
    which is ugly.

<p> It seems as though <code>createElement</code> and
    <code>createActiveElement</code> are only called in a very small number of
    places, so it's pretty painless to have them return an
    <code>ActiveNode</code> (which in most cases is all the caller needs,
    anyway) and check the return type as needed.
    <code>Document.createElement</code> is the obvious exception; it may be
    necessary to resort to wrappers here.

<p>&nbsp;

<p> Of course, the whole gamut of problems simply goes away if we use a tagset
    and handlers to construct the objects, or (perhaps even better) if we move
    the construction into an Output that can do the necessary translation.
    In the latter case the parse tree could be <em>totally</em> passive, and
    the constructed objects need not be even remotely related to DOM objects.
    Using an Output has the additional advantage that it can be driven by a
    SAX parser. 

<p> There's an intermediate position, though, that takes good advantage of the
    way the system works:  Construct objects of appropriate classes in the
    Parser, and assemble them into structures in an Output.  This requires
    that the intermediate objects, at least, be implementations of
    ActiveNode, but that's not really a problem in the PIA where even an Agent
    is basically just a specialized Namespace.  This is similar to what
    TagsetProcessor is doing; the difference is that no processing needs to be
    done, just a copy.

<p> There's also a more extreme version that requires even <code>less</code>
    intervention:  make an I/O pair called <code>ToTabular</code> and
    <code>FromTabular</code>!  That's disgusting: I like it.  Not really
    suitable for things, like agents, that might contain real XML, but it's
    great for headers and Property objects.


<h3>Agent Representation</h3>

<p> An Agent does <em>not</em> have to be an extension of
    <code>TreeGeneric</code> -- <code>TreeElement</code> would do.  Note that
    its name as a namespace wants to be <code>AGENT</code> anyway.  On the
    other hand, <code>BasicNamespace</code> <em>is</em> an extension of
    <code>TreeGeneric</code>, so it's probably moot.  On the <em>other</em>
    other hand, <code>BasicNamespace</code> probably should <em>not</em>
    descend from <code>TreeGeneric</code>.  The only things that do are
    AbstractHandler, BasicTagset, BasicNamespace, and NamespaceWrap.
    <code>TreeDocument</code> perhaps should.  It seems no longer necessary
    for <code>TreeGeneric</code> to have a value component.

<p> <code>TreeGeneric</code> should go back to the function of providing
    separate <em>names</em> for a node when used as an element or something
    else.  In other words, when it's an element the <code>nodeName</code>
    should be the <code>tagName</code>, and the ``other'' name should be the
    <code>name</code> <em>attribute</em>.

<p> The correct way to implement Agent is to make an implementation of
    <code>Namespace</code> called <code>NamespaceExtend</code>.  The intent
    would be similar to <code>NamespaceWrap</code> except that instead of
    always going to <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> on the wrapped
    object, these would instead always go through the bindings.  Just the
    opposite of <code>NamespaceWrap</code>, in fact.  The bindings would then
    include <em>specialized</em> implementations of <code>ActiveEntity</code>
    that go directly to access methods on the extended object.
