<h1>Compiled Document Representations</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> Several times I have alluded to the idea of representing documents as
    compiled code in some programming language such as C.  Such a
    representation is one of the extrema on the time-space continuum, and
    close to an extremum on the efficiency-portability continuum.  (The
    corresponding executable is <em>at</em> the extremum.)

<p> There are actually two distinct ways of representing documents as
    programs:

<ol>
  <li> as an initialized data structure that corresponds to a representation
       of its parse tree

  <li> as a program that, when executed, outputs the document as a character
       stream, with all active constructs expanded.
</ol>

<p> The first technique is significantly more versatile, and avoids problems
    that arise when trying to compile constructs like &lt;expand&gt; that are
    most easily implemented if one has a parse tree representation of the
    document in the first place.  Given a document representation as compiled
    parse trees, the corresponding program is essentially an interpretor.

<p> Note also that the distinction disappears in interpreted languages such as
    LISP, in which trees are used as the base representation of both programs
    and data.

<h2>Document Data Structures</h2>

<p> Even though the W3C's Document Object Model (DOM) specifies a
    representation for document parse trees, it is not really a particularly
    good internal representation for documents, for the following reasons:

<ul>
  <li> The presence of explicit parent links make structure-sharing
       impossible.  Since the DPS always traverses documents in a forward
       direction, parent links are unnecessary.

  <li> There is no explicit support in the DOM for document-formatting
       operations; the only way to compute something like the number of lines,
       columns, or characters in a node is recursively.

  <li> A naive implementation of the DOM requires class inheritance and
       virtual functions, which preclude compile-time initialization in
       languages like C++.  (The question doesn't arise in C, which lacks
       classes.) 
</ul>


<p> There are three plausible organizations for documents:

<ol>
  <li> Represent the entire document as a single array of identical Node
       structures.  This has the advantage of being very simple to construct.
       The drawbacks are that it may require more space (since text, elements,
       attributes, and end tags all need the same size node), and that some
       compilers break when confronted with enormous arrays.

  <li> Represent each Node as a separate, named static variable (or group of
       variables, in some cases).  This is definitely the most straightforward
       method. 

  <li> Represent the document as a list of pointers to, or indices of, nodes.
       This corresponds roughly to a ``threaded-code'' or ``byte-code''
       representation of the document.
</ol>

<p> There is a separate but related decision about the extent to which
    contiguous blocks of text ought to be broken up into words.  This trades
    space overhead for efficiency in operations that split their text content
    on whitespace.  One possible compromise is to make this decision on an
    element-by-element basis.  It's also possible (likely, even) that
    structure sharing (i.e., the <b>flyweight</b> pattern) will gain back more
    space than it costs.


<h2>Design Sketch</h2>

<p> There are two alternatives for representing the children; both have their
    uses. 

<ol>
  <li> Represent a nodelist (either an attribute list or the content of an
       element) as an array of pointers to (or indices of) nodes.  This
       permits structure sharing but requires a complete parse tree for
       construction.

  <li> Using <code>nextSibling</code> and <code>firstChild</code> pointers
       would take the same amount of space, but precludes structure sharing
       within content.  On the other hand, it permits on-the-fly
       construction since it would not be necessary to count children.
       Combined with a special "end-of-list" node that points back to the
       parent, this would allow stackless tree traversal (as in the DOM).
</ol>

<p> Number the elements in the document, and use these numbers in the node
    identifiers.  Use, e.g., <code>e<em>NNN</em></code> for the element,
    <code>a<em>NNN</em></code> for its attribute list array, and
    <code>c<em>NNN</em></code> for its content array.

<p> Alternatively, keep a separate count for each type of element, and
    incorporate the tagname into the identifier, e.g.
    <code>h1_<em>NNN</em></code>.  This would be a little more complex, but
    would result in more readable code. 

<p> Tagnames will normally be represented as indices into a table of
    handlers or as references to descriptor structures.  Here the use of the
    tag name in the corresponding identifier or <code>#define</code> symbol is
    almost obligatory for debugging purposes.
