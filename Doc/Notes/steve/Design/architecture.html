  <p> This document discusses the PIA's architecture, with special reference
      to architectural features that support the development of customizable,
      cross-platform web applications.

  <p> Notes on interfaces (API's and specialized protocols) supported by the
      PIA and their role in integrating the PIA into web servers (especially
      Apache) and other web applications can be found in <a

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p> The PIA architecture has three main components (also referred to below as
    ``features''): 
</p>

<ol>
  <li> <strong><code>dps</code></strong> -- the Document Processing System
       that implements the tag language.  By itself, the DPS essentially
       provides a simple but complete ``macro language'' for XML and HTML web
       pages. 
  </li>
  <li> <strong><code>site</code></strong> -- the site structure package.  This
       provides a simple, robust, versatile, and OS-independent way of
       structuring the files and directories that comprise a web application.
  </li>
  <li> <strong><code>agents</code></strong> -- PIA agents provide the ability
       to operate (using the DPS) on web requests and documents as they
       pass through a PIA-based proxy server.  It is worth noting that most
       PIA applications will not require agents that operate on proxied
       transactions; proxy agents are harder to support in most platforms. 
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>

<p> What follows is the implementation roadmap for cross-platform PIA
    applications:
</p>

<ol>
  <li> Implement the Java interfaces (Servlet, DOM, SAX, in that order).  Even
       though these do not directly lead to a full-featured PIA integrated
       with Apache, they are very simple and we have already committed to
       doing them.  They will give the PIA the highest possible level of
       interoperability with existing XML applications with minimal effort.
       In addition, the Servlet interface will provide a fallback position,
       integrating the PIA's <code>dps</code> and <code>site</code> packages
       with <em>any</em> servlet-based web server.
  </li>

  <li> Ensure that most major PIA applications (except, obviously, the ones in
       <a href="/Agents/Proxie">/Agents/Proxie</a>) still operate in the
       Servlet version.  The fundamental rule is ``<em>you don't know whether
       something is portable until it is actually running on two different
       platforms.</em>'' 
  </li>
</ol>
