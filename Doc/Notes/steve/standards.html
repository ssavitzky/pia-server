<h1>PIA and Standards</h1>

<p> This note discusses the status of the PIA with respect to the various
    standards it uses, follows, and in some cases fails to follow.  In
    particular, it discusses the relationship between the PIA and:

<ul>
  <li> SGML
  <li> XML (including XHTML and XSL)
  <li> SAX
  <li> DOM
  <li> Java
</ul>


<h2>SGML and Document Types</h2>

<p> Active documents in the PIA have <em>two</em> document types: the document
    type of the <em>input</em>, before processing, and the document type of
    the <em>output</em>, after processing.

<h3>Output Documents</h3>

<p> It is our intention to ensure that output documents, i.e. the documents
    seen by a browser or other client, validate against whatever DTD their
    document type specifies.  At the moment, we are using:

<pre>
  &lt;!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN"&gt;
</pre>

<p> Unfortunately, we have not actually validated any of our documents as of
    Release 2.0.2.

<h3>Input Documents</h3>

<p> Active documents, e.g. <code>.xh</code> files, should really have their
    output document type generated automatically, with their input document
    type designating the tags actually contained in the document, i.e. the
    <em>extended</em> document type defined by the tagset.

<p> As of Release 2.0.2, unfortunately, we don't do this.  The document type,
    like other declarations, is simply passed through.   It isn't even parsed,
    which is a (different) problem.  We <em>do</em> plan to fix this.

<h3>Tagsets and DTD's</h3>

<p> Our intention is to generate SGML DTD's automatically from tagsets (using
    a tagset, naturally).  We will have to add a few new constructs in order
    to make this happen.

<p> We also intend to provide a utility to generate ``skeleton'' tagsets from
    DTD's.  Naturally, all of the elements so defined would be passive, but it
    would be a good starting point for anyone developing a custom tagset.

<hr>
<h2>XML and XHTML</h2>

<h3>XHTML</h3>

<p> First and foremost, what <em>we</em> call XHTML is <em>not</em> what the
    W3C calls XHTML.  Theirs is a totally reworked DTD, forcing all of the
    original HTML tags into XML syntax.  Ours is the <em>original</em> HTML
    DTD, with our own active-document tags (the Basic tagset
    <code>basic.ts</code> plus a few extensions) added in a way that conforms
    to HTML syntax, <em>not</em> XML.

<p> It is our expectation that any parser that can handle HTML and recognize
    the XML `<code>/&gt;</code>' convention for empty tags will be able to
    handle our extended HTML.  After we devise a DTD for it, any SGML
    parser should be able to handle it.

<p> <strong>Our XHTML is eXtended HTML, not XML!</strong> We should probably
    rename it.  Like HTML and SGML, and unlike XML, our syntax is designed for
    human creation and editing.  The differences are:

<ol>
  <li> Our parser permits optional end tags.  We find that this greatly
       improves readability and makes documents easier to create with
       HTML-aware editors.
  <li> Our parser does not require a <code>/&gt;</code> in elements that the
       tagset declares as being empty.
  <li> Attribute values that are names need not be quoted.
  <li> Boolean attributes can be minimized. 
  <li> Entities need not be defined.  We use entities as variables.
  <li> Namespaces need not be declared.  We use namespaces as scopes for
       variables and tags. 
</ol>

<p> It is important to note, however, that it is trivial to make the
    <em>output</em> of the PIA's document processor conform to the W3C's XHTML
    DTD if that is considered desirable, and it probably will be at some
    point.  With an appropriate command-line option the stand-alone
    <code>process</code> command would make an excellent HTML clean-up tool.

<h3>XML</h3>

<p> As noted above, our extended HTML documents are not XML.  Our extensions
    are somewhat in the XML <em>style</em>, but they are not (yet) XML.

<p> Nevertheless, it would be desirable in the future to move toward
    converting all of our sample code to XML, so as to make it easier to
    process using (other) standard tools.  It is our intention to do so.

<p> It is <em>not</em> our intention to abandon support for general SGML,
    however.  We intend <em>always</em> to 

<h3>XSL</h3>

<p> XSL (the XML StyleSheet Language) is very similar in intent to the PIA's
    document-processing language.  The unfortunate problem is that XSL drops
    back into JavaScript to perform any operations except the few that XSL
    defines elements for.  We don't need to do that.

<p> We should be able to define a tagset that uses the XSL tags ``on the
    outside'' but uses the PIA's tags for processing in situations where XSL
    drops into JavaScript.  It would be significantly harder to convert
    between these two formats.  This might make a good project for someone in
    the developer community.

<p> Note that the PIA makes an excellent alternative to XSL in situations
    where a JavaScript interpretor is not present. 

<hr>
<h2>SAX Parsers</h2>

<p> A useful near-term step would be to use the SAX interface to allow drop-in
    replacement of our (ad-hoc and rather buggy) parser with any standard
    SGML or XML parser.

<p> Unfortunately, our current interface to the parser is totally different
    from SAX.  SAX is ``event-driven'' -- it reads an input stream and calls a
    callback function whenever a new token is encountered.  Our interface
    treats the parser as a ``virtual tree iterator'' -- the processor calls on
    the parser to traverse the input document's parse tree depth first.

<p> There are three ways of interfacing the PIA's document processor with a
    SAX parser:

<ol>
  <li> Build a complete parse tree and traverse it.  This is trivial, so we
       will probably do it first.  The disadvantage is that the entire tree
       has to live in memory, so it's unsuitable for large documents
       (fortunately we have very few of these) or limited-memory
       (e.g. embedded) applications.

  <li> Run the parser and the processor in separate threads, with a queue of
       partial trees passing between them.  This is not particularly hard, but
       it's not necessary, either.

  <li> Extend the document processor to operate as a SAX back-end, i.e. in
       ``push mode.''  In fact, an earlier version of the processor
       <em>did</em> operate in this mode, so we know that it's not
       particularly difficult.  It will require adding an additional method to
       the <code>Action</code> interface and its implementations, and some
       changes to <code>Context</code> and <code>Processor</code> (all in the
       <code>org.risource.dps</code> package).
</ol>

<p> Our intention is to make the SAX-style parsers an <em>alternative</em> to
    our own technique, not to abandon tree iterators entirely: they're far too
    attractive when you have enough memory to cache whole parse trees.  Things
    will get a <em>little</em> more complicated, but not excessively so.

<p> It's worth noting that our <code>Output</code> interface is <em>very</em>
    similar to SAX.  Making the PIA's document processor <em>look like a SAX
    parser</em> will be trivial.

<hr>
<h2>DOM</h2>

<p> As of Release 2.0.2 the PIA's Document Object Model (as defined in the
    <code>org.risource.dom</code> package) conforms to an earlier draft of the
    W3C's Document Object Model specification, not the recommendation as
    finally approved.  Unfortunately, some classes on which we relied
    heavily (e.g. TreeIterator) disappeared in the interim, and a number of
    behavioral specifications (e.g. live nodelists) appeared that make an
    efficient implementation difficult.

<p> Moreover, it was never the DOM's intention to be a representation for
    SGML documents, only HTML and XML documents and only in the context of a
    client-side scripting language like JavaScript.  The DOM is totally unable
    to deal with documents that do not fit in memory all at once, nor to deal
    with applications that want to move nodes between documents.  

<p> We intend to deal with the situation as follows:

<ol>
  <li> Update our code to use the DOM Level 1 core interfaces defined in <a
       href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-DOM-Level-1-19981001/"
       >www.w3.org/TR/1998/REC-DOM-Level-1-19981001/</a>, as soon as possible.
       This will permit the PIA to use <em>any</em> DOM implementation as a
       drop-in replacement.

  <li> Create <em>two implementations</em> of our ``<code>ActiveNode</code>''
       interface: one a direct implementation, the other a set of ``wrappers''
       for a generic DOM implementation.  Our direct implementation will
       conform to the DOM <em>interface specification</em> (with our
       extensions), but <em>not</em> to the DOM <em>behavioral
       specification</em>, which we will relax to the point where an efficient
       implementation becomes possible.
</ol>

<p> It may be desirable to keep the <code>ActiveNode</code> interfaces as
    self-contained as possible, rather than making them extensions of
    corresponding DOM interfaces.  This would eventually make it easier to
    offer our interfaces as an alternative to the DOM for general SGML
    document-processing applications.

<p> Stand-alone interfaces would represent a significant change from the
    present scheme, but might actually simplify the transition away from the
    old DOM interfaces now in use, which will require major changes anyway.

<p> That said, I expect that the <em>near-term</em> plan should be a
    mixed strategy: try to stay independent at the interface level, but base
    the implementation on the DOM.

<hr>
<h2>Java</h2>

<p> The PIA is currently implemented in Java.  It was originally implemented
    using Java 1.0.1 but rather quickly made the transition to 1.1.  It is now
    implemented almost entirely in the intersection of 1.1 and 1.2, and
    everything but the cryptographic handlers compiles and runs in either.

<p> As of Release 2.1 the PIA's package namespace follows current conventions,
    being entirely under <code>org.risource.*</code>.  Do not be decieved by
    the existance of a <code>src/java</code> directory; this does <em>not</em>
    correspond to the <code>java.*</code> package namespace, but rather to the
    implementation language.  Similarly, PERL modules will go into
    <code>src/perl</code> when we get around to writing them.

<p> The naming of classes and methods is slightly less conventional, and
    reflects both history (the original implementation was in PERL) and
    architectural considerations.  Specifically:

<ul>
  <li> In many cases, especially in older code, the names of ``access
       methods'' conform to PERL rather than Java conventions.  For example,
       the methods to ``get'' and ``set'' an item in a
       <code>org.risource.ds.List</code> are <code>at(int index)</code> and
       <code>at(int index, Object value)</code> rather than the more
       conventional <code>getItem(int index)</code> and <code>setItem(int
       index, Object value)</code>.  Similarly, the access methods for the
       ``name'' attribute of an Agent are <code>name()</code> and
       <code>name(String newName)</code>.

  <li> Some classes have lowercase names.  This indicates a  class that is
       automatically loaded, with the name derived from a tag name or other
       symbol in the PIA's (rather than Java's) namespace.  For example, the
       names of content handlers in <code>org.risource.content</code> are
       derived from MIME types, and the names of tag handlers in
       <code>org.risource.dps.handle</code> are derived from tag names.  
</ul>
