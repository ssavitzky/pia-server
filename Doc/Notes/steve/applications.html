<h1>PIA Application Areas</h1>

<blockquote>
  This document describes web applications for which I believe the PIA is
  well-suited.  Emphasis is placed on applications which are <em>part</em> of
  a website, rather than the whole thing; at the moment the PIA's performance
  is insufficient for use in high-traffic websites, and in any case we believe
  that webmasters are more likely to be interested in adding functionality
  to existing sites than in rebuilding a site from scratch.

<h2>Online Applications</h2>

<blockquote>
<p> This section makes no distinction between internet and intranet
    applications (both are websites), but it is expected that the PIA in its
    present implementation will primarily be useful in intranets.  Its use in
    low-volume internet sites will be limited by the fact that most of these
    are hosted, and few hosting services or ISP's provide Java.  The aggregate
    of these online applications would essentially be an ``intranet-in-a-box''
    for a small business. 
</p>
<p> Note that the easiest way to add a PIA-based application to an existing
    website is to use a <a
    href="../../../src/java/org/risource/servlet">Servlet</a>.  This results
    in the PIA being ``mounted'' as a subdirectory in the website's URL
    space.  A stand-alone PIA server could be used to provide an integrated
    ``intranet-in-a-box.'' 
</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Discussion Forums</h3>

<p> Many sites, e.g. <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>, <a
    href="http://linuxtoday.com/">Linux Today</a>, and <a
    href="http://www.advogato.org/">Advogato</a> consist almost entirely of
    reader contributions.  In some cases the discussions may be mirrored from
    newsgroups or mailing lists, using software like <a
    href="http://www.hypermail.org/">hypermail</a>, but increasingly these are
    stand-alone web applications.  A discussion forum can be particularly
    useful in an intranet, where it can serve as a combination bulletin board,
    suggestion box, and help desk.
</p>

<p> Discussion forum sites generally also have user accounts, usually enabling
    other features.  For example, <a href="http://linuxtoday.com/">Linux
    Today</a> shows a registered user which articles are new since their last
    visit; <a href="http://www.advogato.org/">Advogato</a> includes a rating
    system and includes user's diaries, and a list of projects.  (It's worth
    noting that <a href="http://www.advogato.org/">Advogato</a> is written in
    C as an Apache module (<code>mod_virgule</code>), and uses the Gnome XML
    library to store documents as XML.)
</p>

<h3>Collaborative Authoring</h3>

<p> Here I'm thinking of collaborative environments like the <a
    href="http://minnow.cc.gatech.edu/squeak.127">Wiki-Wiki</a> and <a
    href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~jonh/ff-serve/cache/1.html">FAQ-O-Matic</a>
    servers, where an entire collection of web pages is constructed
    collaboratively.  In an intranet, this can be particularly useful as a way
    of capturing group knowledge.
</p>

<h3>Directories</h3>

<p> The classic example here is <a href="yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>; perhaps a
    better one is <a href="http://dmoz.org/">dmoz</a>, which is
    collaboratively edited.  An internal directory of this sort would be a
    useful addition to any company's intranet. 
</p>

<h3>Portals</h3>

<p> Portals (both configurable sites like <a
    href="http://my.netscape.com/">my.netscape.com</a> and news portals like
    <a href="http://www.svlug.org/">svlug.org</a>) need to pull in information
    from several different sources and present it on a single page, and so
    require HTML processing, information extraction, and reformatting.
</p>

<h3>Calendars</h3>

<p> As we have seen with the IM<sup>3</sup> (<a
    href="http://rsv.ricoh.com/advanced_dev_ctr.html">eCabinet</a> outside of
    RSV), a calendar-like display can be useful for many things, not just
    keeping track of appointments.  In particular, it could be used for
    organizing any chronological sequence of documents or events, including
    mail messages, forms, firewall logs, sales figures, and so on.
</p>

<h3>Home Pages</h3>

<p> Any organization should have an <em>internal</em> home page for every
    computer-using employee.  These pages should, for example, present
    directory information, schedule, and so on in a standardized format.
</p>

<h3>Form Workflow</h3>

<p> We have usually just called this application category ``workflow,'' since
    it is concerned with the flow of forms among the various people who have
    to sign and otherwise handle them.  It's an obvious application for the
    PIA, especially in a small office where the expected volume is small. 
</p>

<h3>Document Workflow</h3>

<p> Something else that deserves to be called ``workflow'' involves the flow
    of, not forms, but <em>documents.</em> Document workflow applications are
    often found in print shops, publishing houses, technical writing
    departments, libraries, advertising agencies, and indeed web application
    development consultancies.  The distinguishing factor in these
    applications is that the work product is a document or a collection of
    documents.  The application and its forms exist simply to manage the flow
    of documents between clients, authors, artists, editors, proofreaders,
    typesetters, FTP sites, and the like. 
</p>

<p> This kind of application can be enormously useful to a small business,
    which may have to handle a document workflow only occasionally (e.g. in
    order to produce a catalog a few times a year).  
</p>

<h3>Document Management</h3>

<p> A web-based document management system would include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> hierarchical, search-based, and chronological views of the collection
  </li>
  <li> version control (e.g. based on CVS)
  </li>
  <li> locking and access control
  </li>
  <li> web-based or traditional application-based editing
  </li>
  <li> WebDAV support
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Offline Applications</h2>

<h3>Formatting: Simple Macro Expansion</h3>

<p> One of the simpler (and hence most compelling) uses of the PIA is for
    applying a uniform look and feel to web pages, using definitions for tags
    like &lt;body&gt;, &lt;header&gt; and &lt;footer&gt;.  This can actually
    be used online, too, but will have to wait for CPIA before it can easily
    rival Apache's server-side includes. 
</p>

<p> Simple macro expansion is characterized by the use of &lt;define&gt; (for
    both tags and entities) and &lt;include&gt;, but little if any use of
    control structure.  Since it requires only simple replacement, it's
    particularly easy for page authors to learn.  
</p>

<h3>Formatting: Advanced</h3>

<p> More advanced formatting operations are exemplified by the slide and
    table-of-contents tagsets.  Here the PIA starts to approach, and in some
    cases exceed, the complexity and capabilities seen in, for example, LaTeX
    and XSLT.  
</p>

<p> It can be expected that most advanced tagsets will be built by programmers
    or advanced web designers (the latter probably using interactive
    ``wizard-like'' (``web-wizard''?) tools when they become available).  
</p>

<h3>Document Indexers</h3>

<h3>Site Maps</h3>


<hr /><!-- ============================================================== -->
<h2>Client-Side Applications</h2>

<p> In client-side applications, the PIA works seamlessly alongside a browser
    that serves as its user interface, typically on the same CPU but always
    under the control of an individual user.  
</p>


<h3>Directory Tree Browsing</h3>

<p> It is possible, using the PIA, to make an entire directory tree ``look
    like'' a single website: easy to navigate, with a uniform look-and-feel
    and a complete set of searchable indices.  The <a
    href="../../../frames.html">PIA Tree Browser</a> is a first step in this
    direction.
</p>

<h3>File Viewers</h3>

<p> Tagsets like <code>slides</code> and <code>tsdoc</code> make it clear that
    the PIA is good for reformatting HTML and XML files; it's less obvious
    that it can be used for viewing files in other formats, but in fact all it
    takes is a suitable parser.
</p>

<h3>Browser Utilities</h3>

<p> The PIA can be used to construct customized sidebars, framesets, link
    pages, and so on for use with browsers.
</p>

<h3>Personal Proxy</h3>

<p> The original PIA application, of course, was as a personal web proxy.  The
    History and ad-buster agents are still useful.  Caching, password
    management, and so on are still possible but harder. 
</p>

<h3>Personal Servers and the Distributed Intranet</h3>

<p> If everyone in an organization has a personal server, it becomes possible
    to distribute many of the traditional functions of an intranet.  For
    example, personal home pages and document collections might be managed and
    served from peoples' desktops.  This structure could cut down on
    unrestricted sharing (i.e. via SMB and NFS), leading to an increase in
    security.  Automatic mirroring and version control would take care of
    backups.   
</p>

<p> This structure for an intranet takes advantage of the fact that disk space
    and compute power are commodities now.  In a way it's the inverse of the
    ``traditional'' file-server-centric structure: everyone's personal machine
    becomes their own storage device, while the centralized server provides
    only document-management services such as indexing, search, version
    control, caching, and backup.
</p>

<p> Inverse proxying provides an good way of doing security: all requests for
    <em>other people's documents</em> go through a centralized server, which
    in turn proxies the request to the appropriate personal server using the
    authentication information of the requestor.  This makes it unnecessary
    for everyone to authenticate separately with everyone else's personal
    server.
</p>

<h3>Configuration File Generators</h3>

<p> Although the PIA can construct non-XML files, it's more interesting to
    consider its uses for constructing and editing configuration files for
    XML-based applications such as Mozilla (not to mention the next version of
    Apache and the PIA itself).  XML data files (as opposed to documents) tend
    to be unmanageably complex and rigidly-structured.  ``Wizard-like''
    web-based tools for constructing them would be welcome, and the PIA
    provides an easy means of building such tools.
</p>

<h3>Web Wizards</h3>

<p> This covers a fairly wide range of wizard-like or template-like
    applications for generating such things as tagsets, DTD's, XML Schemata,
    web pages, and even whole web applications.  See <a
    href="web-wizards.html"><code>web-wizards.html</code></a>.
</p>


<hr /><!-- ============================================================== -->
<h2>Embedded Applications</h2>

<h3>Configuration Servers</h3>

<p> One thing that networked appliances always need is a web server for
    managing their configuration.  This includes web server configuration,
    file server configuration, configuration for specialized hardware, and so
    on.
