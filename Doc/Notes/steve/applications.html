<h1>PIA Application Areas</h1>

<blockquote>
  This document describes web applications for which I believe the PIA is
  well-suited.  Emphasis is placed on applications which are <em>part</em> of
  a website, rather than the whole thing; at the moment the PIA's performance
  is insufficient for use in high-traffic websites, and in any case we believe
  that webmasters are more likely to be interested in adding functionality
  to existing sites than in rebuilding a site from scratch.

<h2>Online Applications</h2>

<blockquote>
<p> Note that the easiest way to add a PIA-based application to an existing
    website is to use a <a
    href="../../../src/java/org/risource/servlet">Servlet</a>.   This results
    in the PIA being ``mounted'' as a subdirectory in the website's URL space.
</p>

<h3>Discussion Forums</h3>

<p> Many sites, e.g. <a href="http://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a> and <a
    href="">Linux Today</a> consist almost entirely of reader contributions.
    In some cases the discussions may be mirrored from newsgroups or mailing
    lists, using software like <a href="">hypermail</a>, but increasingly
    these are stand-alone web applications.  A discussion forum can be
    particularly useful in an intranet, where it can serve as a combination
    bulletin board, suggestion box, and help desk.
</p>

<h3>Collaborative Authoring</h3>

<p> Here I'm thinking of collaborative environments like the <a
    href="">Wiki-Wiki</a> and <a href="">FAQ-O-Matic</a> servers, where an
    entire collection of web pages is constructed collaboratively.  In an
    intranet, this can be particularly useful as a way of capturing group
    knowledge.
</p>

<h3>Calendars</h3>

<p> As we have seen with the IM<sup>3</sup> (<a
    href="http://rsv.ricoh.com/advanced_dev_ctr.html">eCabinet</a> outside of
    RSV), a calendar-like display can be useful for many things, not just
    keeping track of appointments.  In particular, it could be used for
    organizing any chronological sequence of documents or events, including
    mail messages, forms, firewall logs, sales figures, and so on.
</p>

<h3>Form Workflow</h3>

<p> We have usually just called this application category ``workflow,'' since
    it is concerned with the flow of forms among the various people who have
    to sign and otherwise handle them.  It's an obvious application for the
    PIA, especially in a small office where the expected volume is small. 
</p>

<h3>Document Workflow</h3>

<p> Something else that deserves to be called ``workflow'' involves the flow
    of, not forms, but <em>documents.</em> Document workflow applications are
    often found in print shops, publishing houses, technical writing
    departments, libraries, advertising agencies, and indeed web application
    development consultancies.  The distinguishing factor in these
    applications is that the work product is a document or a collection of
    documents.  The application and its forms exist simply to manage the flow
    of documents between clients, authors, artists, editors, proofreaders,
    typesetters, FTP sites, and the like. 
</p>

<p> This kind of application can be enormously useful to a small business,
    which may have to handle a document workflow only occasionally (e.g. in
    order to produce a catalog a few times a year).

<h2>Client-Side Applications</h2>

<p> In client-side applications, the PIA works seamlessly alongside a browser
    that serves as its user interface, typically on the same CPU but always
    under the control of an individual user.  
</p>


<h3>Directory Tree Browsing</h3>

<p> It is possible, using the PIA, to make an entire directory tree ``look
    like'' a single website: easy to navigate, with a uniform look-and-feel
    and a complete set of searchable indices.  The <a
    href="../../../frames.html">PIA Tree Browser</a> is a first step in this
    direction.
</p>

<h3>File Viewers</h3>

<p> Tagsets like <code>slides</code> and <code>tsdoc</code> make it clear that
    the PIA is good for reformatting HTML and XML files; it's less obvious
    that it can be used for viewing files in other formats, but in fact all it
    takes is a suitable parser.
</p>

<h3>Browser Utilities</h3>

<p> The PIA can be used to construct customized sidebars, framesets, link
    pages, and so on for use with browsers.
</p>

<h3>Personal Proxy</h3>

<p> The original PIA application, of course, was as a personal web proxy.
</p>

<h3>Configuration File Generators</h3>

<p> Although the PIA can construct non-XML files, it's more interesting to
    consider its uses for constructing and editing configuration files for
    XML-based applications such as Mozilla (not to mention the next version of
    Apache and the PIA itself).  XML data files (as opposed to documents) tend
    to be unmanageably complex and rigidly-structured.  ``Wizard-like''
    web-based tools for constructing them would be welcome, and the PIA
    provides an easy means of building such tools.
