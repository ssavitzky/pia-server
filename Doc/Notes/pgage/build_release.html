<h1>Building the PIA Source Release Tar File</h1>

<p> The build is done from your CVS working directory; however, the script
    does a clean checkout into a separate directory, <code>$REL_DIR</code>,
    which is set to <code>$(HOME)/src_release</code> by default.  The actual
    release build is done in this directory, not your working directory.
</p>

<p> Note that the build process is specific to the environment at Ricoh CRC;
    so far, that's where all releases are made.  The gzipped tar file is
    generated directly in <code>/pia1/pia/pia_src<em>version</em>.tgz</code>
    and copied to the <a href="http://www.RiSource.org/">RiSource.org</a>
    website.  The release directory used to be copied over to
    <code>/pia1/pia</code> as <code>src_release<em>version</em></code>; this
    is no longer done by default.  Since the PIA is now open source, binary
    releases are no longer made, either.  Old src_release directories can just
    be deleted; <code>.tgz</code> files should be kept around for reference.
</p>

<h3>Preliminary Checking</h3>

<p> Use the following command to ensure that references to your home directory
    have not snuck into the code; typically this happens when you save an
    <code>AGENT.xml</code> file for a new agent.  (Note that the references to
    <code>/home/steve</code> in <code>Doc/intro.html</code> are OK -- they're
    in an example.)

<pre>
find . -type f \! -name \*class \! -name Root \! -name Repository -print0 |\
xargs -0 -e grep -n -e "$HOME"
</pre>

<p> Replace <code>$HOME</code> with <code>/pia1</code> to catch additional
    references to CRC's local directory structure.  References in the
    top-level Makefile and this note are OK because they involve the release
    process; a few other references occur in comments.

<p> Of course, you should make sure that the PIA actually runs on your
    machine, and that the links (at least on the home page) are still good.  

<h3>The Build Steps</h3>

<blockquote>
  Note that an abbreviated summary of the build process can be found in the
  top-level <a href="/PIA/Makefile">Makefile</a>.
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li> Before doing the build, update these variables in 
       <code>PIA/Makefile</code>: 
       <pre>
       RELEASE     = 2
       MAJOR       = 0
       MINOR       = 5
       SUFFIX      = a </pre></li>

  <li> <code>CVS commit Makefile </code><br />

       The build does a clean checkout from the repository and will use the
       version of the Makefile that is checked out, not the version in your
       working directory.
      </li>

  <li> <code>make prep-checkout</code> <br />
       This updates the pia version numer,
       removes the previous release directory, and tags the respository
       if <code>CREATE_CVS_TAG</code> has been set to 1.  This is fairly
       expensive; if you are only changing the minor version number, consider
       doing <code>make update-version</code> instead.
       </li>

  <li> <code>make rsync-cvs</code> -- synchronize CVS repositories<br />

       This uses <code>rsync</code> to synchronize the internal and external
       cvs respositories.  You have to be running under <code>ssh-agent</code>
       for this to work.  Otherwise, you'll have to do it manually so that
       <code>ssh</code> can prompt you for your passphrase:
       
       <pre>
cd /pia1/CvsRoot
rsync -e ssh -a --numeric-ids --delete -v PIA cvs.risource.org:/home/cvsroot/ </pre>
       Don't be alarmed by the fact that this uploads everything -- the
       previous step (tagging) changes every file in the repository.  Can't be
       helped. 
       </li>
       

  <li><code>make src-release</code> -- This does the rest of the build. <br />

       The following table gives the make targets for the individual build
       steps in case you need to re-do or omit any of them.  They all operate
       on the build directory, so you don't have to <code>cd</code> if you
       don't want to.  The build no longer involves a
       <code>make&nbsp;clean</code>, so a minor release can be made without a
       complete rebuild.  <code>build_release</code> does make
       <code>doc</code>, so it is <em>strongly</em> recommended that your
       machine have at least 128Mb of RAM.

     <table>
       <tr><td><code>do_checkout</code></td>
           <td>check out the release <em>from the public server</em>.</td></tr>
       <tr><td><code>build_release</code></td>
           <td>Build the code and documentation</td></tr>
       <tr><td><code>tar_file</code></td>
           <td>Make a compressed tar file in /pia1/pia.</td></tr>
       <tr><td><code>&nbsp;</code></td>
           <td>Link the tar file to pia_src.tgz.</td></tr>
     </table>

       <p> <code>make copy_src_dir</code> is now optional; it copies the
	   src_release directory to /pia1/pia.  It uses up quite a lot of
	   space, and can lead to directory trees that are hard to delete. 

  <li> Check for errors. <br />

       The most common one is a <code>javadoc</code> failure; you can
       partially fix this with

       <pre>
       cd ~/src_release/PIA/src/java
       make jdoc</pre>
       This doesn't build the indices, unfortunately.

  <li> Update the <code>www.RiSource.org</code> website.  This is best done via
       the <code>ssh</code> (secure shell) and <code>scp</code> (secure copy)
       commands. 
       <ul>
	 <li> Edit <code>RiSource.org/PIA/latest.html</code> (the ``what's new''
	      page) and copy it to
	      <code>/home/web/risource-htdocs/PIA</code>
	 <li> Copy the newly-created <code>.tgz</code> file to
	      <code>/home/ftp/PIA</code>
	 <li> Make <code>/home/ftp/PIA/pia_src.tgz</code> a symbolic link to the
	      new <code>.tgz</code> file. 
       </ul>

</ol>
