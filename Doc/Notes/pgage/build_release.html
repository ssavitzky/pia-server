<h1>Building the PIA Source Release Tar File</h1>

<p> The build is done from your CVS working directory; however, the script
    does a clean checkout into a separate directory, <code>$REL_DIR</code>,
    which is set to <code>$(HOME)/src_release</code> by default.  The actual
    release build is done in this directory, not your working directory.
</p>

<p> The release directory is copied over to <code>/pia/pia1</code> as
    <code>src_release<em>version_number</em></code>.
    Old src_release directories can just be deleted.
</p>

<h3>The Build Steps</h3>

<ol>
  <li> Before doing the build, update these variables in 
       <code>PIA/Makefile</code>: 
       <pre>
       RELEASE     = 2
       MAJOR       = 0
       MINOR       = 5
       SUFFIX      = a </pre></li>

  <li> <code>CVS commit Makefile </code><br />

       The build does a clean checkout from the repository and will use the
       version of the Makefile that is checked out, not the version in your
       working directory.
      </li>

  <li> <code>make prep-checkout</code> <br />
       This updates the pia version numer,
       removes the previous release directory, and tags the respository
       if <code>CREATE_CVS_TAG</code> has been set to 1.  This is fairly
       expensive; if you are only changing the minor version number, consider
       doing <code>make update-version</code> instead.
       </li>

  <li> <code>make rsync-cvs</code> -- synchronize CVS repositories<br />

       This uses <code>rsync</code> to synchronize the internal and external
       cvs respositories.  You have to be running under <code>ssh-agent</code>
       for this to work.  Otherwise, you'll have to do it manually, so
       <code>ssh</code> can prompt you for your passphrase:
       
       <pre>
cd /pia1/CvsRoot
rsync -e ssh -a --numeric-ids --delete -v PIA cvs.risource.org:/home/cvsroot/ </pre>
       Don't be alarmed by the fact that this uploads everything -- the
       previous step (tagging) changes every file in the repository.  Can't be
       helped. 
       </li>
       

  <li><code>make src-release</code> -- This does the rest of the build. <br />

       The following table gives the make targets for the individual build
       steps in case you need to re-do any of them.  They all operate on the
       build directory, so you don't have to <code>cd</code> if you don't want
       to.  The build no longer involves a <code>make&nbsp;clean</code>, so 
       a minor release can be made without a complete rebuild.

     <table>
       <tr><td><code>do_checkout</code></td>
           <td>check out the release <em>from the public server</em>.</td></tr>
       <tr><td><code>build_release</code></td>
           <td>Build the code and documentation</td></tr>
       <tr><td><code>tar_file</code></td>
           <td>Make a compressed tar file in /pia1/pia.</td></tr>
       <tr><td><code>&nbsp;</code></td>
           <td>Link the tar file to pia_src.tgz.</td></tr>
       <tr><td><code>copy_src_dir</code></td>
           <td>Copy the src_release directory to /pia1/pia.</td></tr>
       <tr><td><code>&nbsp;</code></td>
           <td> This may not be strictly necessary, but it lets you check
		quickly what was in the last release.  <code>rsync</code> is
		used in case you need to do it again. </td></tr>
     </table>

  <li> Check for errors. <br />

       The most common one is a <code>javadoc</code> failure; you can
       partially fix this with

       <pre>
       cd ~/src_release/PIA/src/java
       make jdoc</pre>
       This doesn't build the indices, unfortunately.

  <li> Update the <code>www.RiSource.org</code> website.  This is best done via
       the <code>ssh</code> (secure shell) and <code>scp</code> (secure copy)
       commands. 
       <ul>
	 <li> Edit <code>RiSource.org/PIA/latest.html</code> (the ``what's new''
	      page) and copy it to
	      <code>/home/web/risource-htdocs/PIA</code>
	 <li> Copy the newly-created <code>.tgz</code> file to
	      <code>/home/ftp/PIA</code>
	 <li> Make <code>/home/ftp/PIA/pia_src.tgz</code> a symbolic link to the
	      new <code>.tgz</code> file. 
       </ul>

</ol>
