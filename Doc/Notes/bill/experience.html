<h1>PIA user-experience proposal</h1>

<p> This is Bill Softky's approach to extending and popularizing the
PIA. It is probably fraught with misconceptions at this stage, so
should be taken as just the opening statement of an ongoing
discussion on how to anticipate and surmount potential user-acceptance
problems with the PIA.

Such issues are listed below.


<h5><a name="XML-rep"> The spirit vs. the letter of XML</a></h5>


According to a prominent source (Goldfarb, the "G" of SGML), the purpose of XML
markup is to annotate the content of very narrowly-defined document
types, explicitly leaving display processing (and implicitly other
forms of processing) to be done by other files, like stylesheets.

The PIA, on the other hand, uses markup as "verbs" as well as
"adjectives," and encourages the inclusion of as much
document-specific processing as possible inside the document to give
it maximal flexibility.  While this approach is perfectly legal in the
XML language, it might create some confusion for people steeped in the
XML philosophy.



<h5><a name="XML-rep">  "Easy to use" vs. powerful</a></h5>

PIA will express all kinds of dissimilar concepts --annotation of
content, logical relations, structured procedures, graphical
properties, references to external data-- in a single language of
"tags." 

 But those different concepts have traditionally been expressed most
successfully in different (and often more intuitive) languages:
logical expressions using nested parentheses with "&" and "|"
symbols, structured procedures using curly braces and function calls,
graphical styles using WYSIWYG displays and editing.  So we risk
alientating users by asking them to depart from familiar conventions,
and by asking them to use conventions which are often clumsier than
the ones they are accustomed to (I find even simple loops hard to read
in PIA).

 <em> <p> I suggest focussing on a user interface which has two parts,
one for viewing a PIA document directly (using colors and shaded
regions to clarify structure) and one to show the "results"
(e.g. graphical outputs) of the document. A language as powerful and
simple as PIA, if its power is properly used, will naturally lead to
documents which may be hard to view directly, especially by
non-programmer office personnel.</em> <p>

<h5><a name="XML-rep">Straight-line  vs. "logical" document styles</a></h5>

The first document/tagset I looked at was the admin-agent one, for
which the .xh file was a few lines of  wrapper around the <agent-index>
element, which was defined in the logical tagset order rather than in
the top-to-bottom order of a more traditional document... as a result,
I never got to see any text which "looked like" the graphics on my
browser, so I became rather confused.  

This example seems to me to illuminate a central tension in any kind
of programming, that between straight-line code (which is often poorly
structured and redundant but easy to read) and highly modular,
structured code, which is more elegant and better matched to the
problem but often difficult to piece together, especially for an
unfamiliar or inexpert user.  

 <em> <p> I hope that we can get the best of both worlds, first by
suggesting through our documents and examples that the primary
document not be overly tag-ified or wrapped, and second by creating
editors and/or display mechanisms which can somehow unwrap the logical
structure into a more human-readable form, e.g. by executing and/or
filling in some of the active tags. </em> <p>


<h5><a name="XML-rep">"All-in-one-place" vs modularized documents</a></h5>

One of the biggest appeals of PIA is the ability to contain and edit
all the relevant aspects of a document in one or two files.  But the
desire for modularity, reusable tags, and content which is extracted
or included from elsewhere naturally encourages creating
general-purpose tags which reside in libraries elsewhere and documents
which are created from lots of scattered pieces.

As above, these are actually reflections of the strength and power of
PIA, which if harnessed will make synchronizing batches of
inter-related documents much easier.  But that power and ease will
only come about if a naive user can easily understand the live
document from its separate components.


 <em> <p>   As above, I think we should take steps to reduce the number of
tiers in the hierarchy of tags, and create interfaces which make those
tiers more transparent or more easily linked together. </em> <p>


<h5><a name="XML-rep">Content+processing
vs. solitary+reusable</a></h5>

My impression of XML is that it tries to enforce a strict separation
between "content" and "processing" (a.k.a. display style). But PIA
makes it possible to create content <em> by means of </em> processing
(via extracting, looping, deciding etc).  If we try to keep to the XML
approach, we will be forced either to put document-specific stuff into
a tag-set--thus making it less general-purpose---or to avoid using
those powerful tags for automatic content creation.

 <em> <p> I think we should avoid that particular XML philosophy, and
continue to do what we are already doing: placing any worthwhile
document-specific stuff in the document, and any obviously reusable
stuff in a tagset... with the proviso that the tagset, because it is
supposed to be reusable by many different documents, NOT be linked to
that particular one. </em> <p>

<h5><a name="XML-rep">Downloading a language vs. an application</a></h5>

Far more people want to download a useful application (which they can
run quickly, without learning anything) than download and learn a
whole new language.  So PIA would get a huge boost in popularity if it
could implement a really neat service which lots of people would like.

<p> <em> If we could implement a platform-independent proxie which
automatically removed ads from a web page--ideally before downloading
all their graphics!--it might prove to be very popular... and if
PIA is sufficiently easy to use, it might encourage people to
tinker with customizing their own proxie and/or ad-nuking algorithms,
which we could collect and redistribute under the Open Source license.
Of course, I don't know if we could actually implement such a thing,
but I can imagine being  heros if we did. </em> <p>

<h5><a name="XML-rep">Who are our first customers?</a></h5>

The ideal customer for PIA is someone who wants to maintain web pages
without being a web programmer, such as an office admin worker.  But
those people aren't likely to know or care about open-source
downloads, or really understand the choices and advantages of
PIA... in fact, they aren't even likely to be making the decision
about what language and platform the use (the IT lead will make that
call). So we need to first target a population of people who understand
the need, have the need, and are likely to find out about PIA.  

<em> <p> I propose aiming at people who want to produce and easily
update static web pages (e.g. personal home pages) on off-site
servers... they can use PIA as a template for creating lists,
catalogues, and such in static HTML (easily, we hope).  So the second
application (after the ad-remover above) could be a static-HTML generator.<p>

We can also target people who have control over their own servers and
thus can run Java on them; they might make use of the active and
interactive aspects of PIA.  So the third application is an
active-form server, e.g. for small companies. <p>

Finally, once the bugs have been worked out and PIA gets some
popularity, we might be ready to introduce it to the ultimate target
user-group, the office-worker types... but that will require the
interest and involvement of their managers.  This application could be
a suite (form servers, web printers, etc) for intranets. <p>

And ultimately, if we can implement the active tags as compiled
binaries (nice and fast!), we might hope that PIA gets used on higher-traffic servers
in major applications.  </em> <p>
