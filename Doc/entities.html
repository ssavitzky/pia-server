<body><center><h1>XHTML Entity Reference</h1></center><p>PIA entities
are named objects that can be referred to in interforms. They function
much like variables or macros in that they can be defined and later
replaced by their definition.</p><p>XHTML entities follow the same
conventions as XML entities and therefore begins with an ampersand
(<code>&#38;</code>) followed by a name, and ends with a semicolon
(<code>;</code>). </p><p>More formally the rules for entity creation
might be specified as follows:</p><dl><dt>entity ::= '' name ';'
  </dt>
<dt>name ::= [identifier ':']? identifier   </dt>
<dt>identifier := [letter | digit | '-' | '_' | '.']+   </dt></dl><p>Case
is <em>significant</em> in entity names. </p><p>Thus to reference
the current day of the week one might include the following text:</p><blockquote><code>Today
is &#38;day;</code>.</blockquote><p>This text might be evaluated,
assuming that this is the start of a new work week, as:</p><blockquote><code>Today
is Monday.</code></blockquote>An entity name can consist of a pair
of sub-names separated by a colon (<code>:</code>). These sub-names form
a path (similar to a file path) through a sequence of "namespaces."
If no namespace is given, the interpreter searches through any locally-defined
entities (for example, the list element entity defined by the repeat
tag) and the top-level (global) entity table associated with the
interform being interpreted.<p>Entities can be used as "iteration
variables." For example, you can repeat some text for every item
in a list. The <code>&#38;li;</code> entity is replaced by each
list item in turn.</p><p>The document <code><a>Evaluated Entities</a></code> shows
the value on your system of each of the entities listed below.</p><table
