<h1>Troubleshooting Guide</h1>



<p> Here are some frequently encountered problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<p> <strong>The PIA doesn't seem to pay attention to changes in a file, or
    doesn't read or write a file where expected.</strong>  This usually
    occurs because there are two parallel directory trees: <code>PIA/</code>
    and <code>.pia/</code> (or more formally, <code>$PIA_HOME/</code> and
    <code>$PIA_ROOT/</code>), and <code>.pia/</code> takes precedence.  So
    changes made in the <code>PIA/</code> tree may (or may not) be used,
    depending upon whether there is a corresponding file in the
    <code>.pia/</code> tree: the server always reads files in
    <code>.pia/</code> first if it can, and always writes them there. </p>
    </li>

     <strong> The PIA doesn't seem to pay attention to newly-written tags,
	       extensions, or configuration options.</strong> This usually
	       occurs for one of two reasons.
     <ol> <li>The PIA was not restarted after a change (and thus did not know
	       about recent configuration changes).  The solution is to
	       restart the PIA after every configuration change, i.e. after
	       changing anything but the contents of <code>.xh</code> or
	       <code>.ts</code> file.</li>
	  <li> The PIA was not instructed to use the appropriate tagset or
	       extension.  While tags defined inside an active page are
	       automatically used, separate ".ts" tagset files are only used
	       when the <code>_subsite.xcf</code> file explicitly says
	       so.  So make sure that the file-extension type and desired
	       tagsets are explicitly mentioned (look at <code>Agents/</code>,
	       <code>Samples/</code>, and <code>Config/Site/</code> for
	       working examples.) </li>
      </ol>
     </p></li>

        <li>
<p> <strong>When testing for equality, the PIA thinks two things (strings,
    numbers, entities) are different when they should be the same.</strong>
    The PIA keeps track of <i>everything</i> in an object or entity, including
    carriage returns and leading/trailing spaces.  Unfortunately, when you
    follow proper indentation rules, all that invisible stuff becomes part of
    your object and changes it in subtle ways.  Here's an example of the
    problem and one way to fix it (you can find other such example solutions
    in our applications, such as SimpleCalendar):</p>
	     
	     <code><pre>
    Bad:     &lt;set name="hometown">
	         SiliconValley
	     &lt;/set>
             </pre></code>

    <p> In this case, the entity <code>hometown</code> contains leading and
	trailing carriage returns and spaces, which will register as separate
	text elements in a list and may disrupt tests like <nobr><code>&lt;test
	match="SiliconValley">&amp;hometown;&lt;/test></code></nobr>.  Here's the
	fix, which involves explicity trimming off that invisible stuff: </p>

	     <code><pre>	     
    Good:    &lt;set name="hometown">&lt;text trim="yes">
	         SiliconValley
	     &lt;/text>&lt;/set>
             </pre></code>

	     
    </li>


	<li>
<p> <strong> Lots of blank lines appear in the browser's "Page Source" window,
    and/or lists which should be empty do not test as empty, even after
    trimming.</strong> You may be using standard HTML-style comments
    <nobr><code>&lt;!-- like this --&gt;</code></nobr>, which the processor
    keeps track of (along with all the spaces and carriage returns between
    them!).  We suggest you instead use our special style of comments
    <nobr><code>&lt;?-- like this --?&gt;</code></nobr>, which are stripped
    away before any processing is done.

	     </p> </li>

</ul>
