  <li> <b>Hole</b> State maintenance <br>
       When a subsite's properties are changed, the changes have to be written
       out.  Concievably this could be done as a delta file, maybe even
       <code>_subsite.xci</code>, that is always read in after the
       <code>_subsite.xcf</code>.  It can even be defaulted so that, e.g.,
       agents are read only once.  Alternatively one could save only the
       properties, as a namespace.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Cached entities <br>
       Need a way to specify that certain documents are to be cached as
       entities.  This is another way to do state maintenance, giving
       finer-grained control over what's preserved and what isn't, at the
       expense of some conceptual complication for the developer. 

  <li> <b>Hole</b> PropertyTable needs a handler. <br>
       Need to be able to save PropertyTable objects, and read them back in.
       This may very well replace Namespace for everything except entities.

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Need a way to construct named nodes <br>
       For example, declarations and processing instructions need both a name
       and a type.

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Replace DOCTYPE's in XML <br>
       with, e.g., a &lt;DOCTYPE&gt; element. 

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Caching <br>
       Need both ability to tee-off and save a proxied document, and a
       &lt;copy&gt; tag (along the lines of &lt;input&gt; and &lt;output&gt;).
       Possibly just &lt;connect&gt; with both <code>src</code> and
       <code>dst</code> attributes.

  <li> <b>Bug</b> GIF conversion <br>
       Need to convert all <code>.gif</code> files to <code>.jpeg</code> or
       <code>.png</code> to avoid patent entanglements.

  <li> <b>Wish</b> Use PIA off-line for RiSource.org <br>
       Should be an example of off-line website management with the PIA.

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Non-strict HTML parsing <br>
       Need a "nonstrict" attribute in &lt;tagset&gt;.

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Separate tutorials and references <br>
       Possibly bring back the old ``Manuals'' directory, or perhaps just move
       each reference into its own subdirectory (which is true of tagset and
       api references now).

  <li> <b>Bug</b> The FAQ documents are <em>totally</em> out of date. <br>
