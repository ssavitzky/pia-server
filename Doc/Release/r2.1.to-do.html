<title>PIA Release 2.1: To-Do List</title>
</head><body>
<h1>R2.1: To-Do List</h1>

<blockquote><em>
<p> This file contains pending tasks for the transition from the Release 2.0
    series to the stable Release 2.1 series.  <strong>Other PIA developers are
    encouraged to add their own favorites.</strong>

<p> Items labeled <b>Impr</b> or <b>Wish</b> are lower priority and may not be
    fixed by 2.1.0, but are considered important enough to mention.  Some
    items labeled <b>Hole</b> may also be optional.

<p> See the various source-code <code>to-do</code> and <code>done</code> files
    for details.  At each point release (e.g. 2.0.8), completed items are
    deleted from this file; they can be found in the appropriate
    <code>done</code> file.
</em></blockquote>

<p> Items are grouped as follows:

<ul>
  <li> <a href="#code">Code</a> 
  <li> <a href="#doc">Documentation</a>
  <li> <a href="#other">Other</a>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li> 2000-02-23 <b>Bug</b> Handle mixed-case attributes <br>
        Mixed-case attributes need to work.  

  <li> 2000-02-22 <b>Bug</b> subst bug <br>
       seems to substitute for one char to the left of the match.  This
       is either a bug in the library or a result of an old workaround (adding
       null to end of string) that may no longer be necessary.

  <li> 2000-02-25 <b>Hole</b> Entity and Attr should keep value in children <br>
       This would fix many problems with entities, extract, etc. -- it will
       also break some things.  It's needed for cached entities.  Entities, at
       least, should also know their tagset.  It also brings us back into DOM
       compliance, for what (little) that's worth.

  <li> <b>Bug</b> POST breaks when proxied through Apache. <br>
       Just spins its wheels.  Should time out.
       (1999-12-09) <br>

       <p>
       <p>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Safe version of &lt;define&gt; <br>
       and file-only and http-only versions of &lt;include&gt; etc.; use
       ``suspect'' to turn off loading of <code>.xcf</code> and
       <code>.ts</code> files in subsites -- go up to non-suspect subsite.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Servlet support <br>
       We need two servlets: PIAServlet, which includes the Subsite mapping
       stuff, and DPSServlet, which only does processing.
       
  <li> <b>Hole</b> URL-manipulation tag <br>
       something like &lt;date&gt; but for URL's.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Language cleanup <br>
       <ul>
	 <li> <code>op="<em>operation</em>"</code> attrs (2000-02-17)
	 <li> other attribute cleanup. <br />
	        &lt;define syntax=...&gt; (2000-02-23)<br />
	        default <code>case="sensitive"</code>. (2000-02-25)
	 <li> &lt;text split="<em>sep</em>" join="<em>sep</em>"&gt;
	      (could actually leave <code>sep</code> instead of join)
	 <li> Parametrize ``<code>&amp;</code>'' and ``<code>:</code>'' in
	      tagset attributes.
       </ul>
       <p>

  <li> <em>=== somewhere around here is the cutoff for 2.1 === </em><!-- === -->

       <p>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> SAX / DOM support<br>
       With DOM we get Cocoon as well.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> XML namespace support <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Ability to re-read config files. <br>
       Mainly needs the ability to uninstall agents.  Pretty easy if we keep a
       list in the Subsite and uninstall them by object ID.  Requires
       <code>{un}registerAgent</code> in Site.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Additional file prefixes in Subsite <br>
       Need access to files relative to root, vroot, and home. 

  <li> <b>Hole</b> State maintenance <br>
       When a subsite's properties are changed, the changes have to be written
       out.  Concievably this could be done as a delta file, maybe even
       <code>_subsite.xci</code>, that is always read in after the
       <code>_subsite.xcf</code>.  It can even be defaulted so that, e.g.,
       agents are read only once.  Alternatively one could save only the
       properties, as a namespace.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Cached entities <br>
       Need a way to specify that certain documents are to be cached as
       entities.  This is another way to do state maintenance, giving
       finer-grained control over what's preserved and what isn't, at the
       expense of some conceptual complication for the developer. 

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Namespaces/Entities in files <br>
       A necessary part of the cached entity/state maintenance puzzle is the
       ability to put a namespace in a file (i.e. have a namespace in a system
       entity) and keep it updated.  This may be an instance of the more general
       problem of structure-modification operations inside <em>any</em> system
       entity.  The correct solution may be to write all changed entities when
       they go out of context (scope), i.e. when a TopProcessor exits.

       <p>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Get attribute-list case sens. from tagset <br>
       Need to case-fold attributes correctly for the tagset.

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Correct handling for character entities. <br>
       Currently they're not defined, which causes several kinds of havoc.
       If we define them, need "retain" in many cases (e.g. &amp;nbsp;).

  <li> <b>Impr</b> shouldn't split on whitespace sometimes <br>
       e.g. in &lt;from&gt;, and &lt;foreach&gt;.  Requires a reliable
       &lt;text split&gt; operation. [Downgraded to Impr from Bug because it's
       performing to spec, but the spec's just not good.]

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Copying Documents <br>
       Want both ability to tee-off and save a proxied document, and a
       &lt;copy&gt; tag (along the lines of &lt;input&gt; and &lt;output&gt;).
       Possibly just &lt;connect&gt; with both <code>src</code> and
       <code>dst</code> attributes.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> PUT <br>
       Need the ability to create documents using PUT requests.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> TEXT tagset <br>
       Need a tagset and associated parser that simply treats files as text
       nodes. 

  <li> <b>Impr</b> HEAD, <code>IfModifiedSince</code> <br>
       It would be useful if we could support HEAD requests (for everything)
       and support the <code>IfModifiedSince</code> header for static pages.

       <p>
</ol>

<p> The following are currently low priority, since ampersands in URL's are
    working reasonably well at the moment.

<ol>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> toString for Element could use ToString <br>
       i.e. toString for element nodes could just use Copy and
       ToString -- end of story.  (Note that you can get startString by simply
       doing startNode on a ToString.  startString is no longer used outside
       of <code>dps</code>.)

  <li> <b>Impr</b> don't use toString in Output. <br>
       Conversion of nodes to external form should be done via a properly-
       parametrized set of methods that can be called by an Output, or
       directly in the Output (which is cleaner but makes it impossible to
       have specialized elements).<br>

       Parameters should include indent, line width, etc.  Possibly give the
       nodes access to <code>write</code>, etc. in a subclass of Output.
       Output formatting is a time sink; we don't have to get it exactly right
       the first time.  The important thing is not to rely on toString for
       converting NodeList's and AttrList's.

  <li> <b>Impr</b> clean way of putting node lists on outputs. <br>
       It would be convenient if there was a simple way to put a list onto an
       Output.  Probably a method on ActiveNodeList would be best.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Can't make (nodeBuilder) or parse arbitrary decl's. <br>
       basically need to fix constructor for TreeDecl.
       
</ol>

<h2><a name="doc">Documentation</a></h2>

<ol>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> Samples needs HEADER.html<br>
       So do some other directories, probably, but that's an obvious one.
       
  <li> <b>Impr</b> Separate tutorials and references <br>
       Possibly bring back the old ``Manuals'' directory, or perhaps just move
       each reference into its own subdirectory (which is true of tagset and
       api references now).

  <li> <b>Bug</b> The FAQ documents are <em>totally</em> out of date. <br>

</ol>

<h2><a name="other">Other</a></h2>

<ol>
  <li> <b>Hole</b> Find places for mini-apps <br>
       There are two kinds: PIA apps (for which Samples is the cannonical
       location), and <code>process</code> apps -- need a good place for the
       latter.  Possibly <code>bin</code> for scripts and <code>lib</code> for
       tagsets. 

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Move CVS tree outside firewall, tunnel server. <br>
       This has to be done in order to give outside developers access.  It's
       probably simpler to use <code>ssh</code> to tunnel the CVS password
       server's port through the firewall, but more egalitarian to move the
       server outside.

  <li> <b>Wish</b> Use <code>process</code> for RiSource.org <br>
       Should be an example of off-line website management with the PIA.
