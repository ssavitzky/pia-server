<h2><a name="code">Code</a></h2>

<ol>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> Non-strict HTML parsing needed. <br>
       Need a "nonstrict" attribute in &lt;tagset&gt;. Distinguish between
       XHTML (XML) and HTMLX (HTML with eXtensions).  Need a more general way
       to get at tagset attributes. 

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Correct handling for character entities. <br>
       Currently they're not defined, which causes several kinds of havoc.
       Even defining them, though, doesn't seem to work right.

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Conversion of text to <em>internal</em> form broken. <br>
       The consequence is that STRING nodes and <code>href</code> attributes
       containing ampersands don't work.

  <li> <b>Impr</b> printOn instead of toString <br>
       Conversion of nodes to external form should be done via a properly-
       parametrized set of methods that can be called by an Output.
       <code>toString</code> should return the internal form.  Parameters
       should include indent, line width, etc.

       <p>

  <li> <b>Bug</b> PropertyTable needs a handler. <br>
       Need to be able to save PropertyTable objects, and read them back in.
       This may very well replace Namespace for everything except entities.
       It should also simplify site configuration files.

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Need a way to construct named nodes <br>
       For example, declarations and processing instructions need both a name
       and a type.

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Replace DOCTYPE's in XML <br>
       with, e.g., a &lt;DOCTYPE&gt; element. 

       <p>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> State maintenance <br>
       When a subsite's properties are changed, the changes have to be written
       out.  Concievably this could be done as a delta file, maybe even
       <code>_subsite.xci</code>, that is always read in after the
       <code>_subsite.xcf</code>.  It can even be defaulted so that, e.g.,
       agents are read only once.  Alternatively one could save only the
       properties, as a namespace.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Cached entities <br>
       Need a way to specify that certain documents are to be cached as
       entities.  This is another way to do state maintenance, giving
       finer-grained control over what's preserved and what isn't, at the
       expense of some conceptual complication for the developer. 

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Namespaces in files <br>
       A necessary part of the cached entity/state maintenance puzzle is the
       ability to put a namespace in a file (i.e. have a namespace in a system
       entity) and keep it updated.  This may be an instance of the more general
       problem of structure-modification operations inside <em>any</em> system
       entity.  The correct solution may be to write all changed entities when
       they go out of context (scope), i.e. when a TopProcessor exits.

       <p>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Copying Documents <br>
       Want both ability to tee-off and save a proxied document, and a
       &lt;copy&gt; tag (along the lines of &lt;input&gt; and &lt;output&gt;).
       Possibly just &lt;connect&gt; with both <code>src</code> and
       <code>dst</code> attributes.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> TEXT tagset <br>
       Need a tagset and associated parser that simply treats files as text
       nodes. 

  <li> <b>Hole</b> PUT <br>
       Need the ability to create documents using PUT requests.

  <li> <b>Impr</b> HEAD, <code>IfModifiedSince</code> <br>
       It would be useful if we could support HEAD requests (for everything)
       and support the <code>IfModifiedSince</code> header for static pages.

</ol>

<h2><a name="doc">Documentation</a></h2>

<ol>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> Separate tutorials and references <br>
       Possibly bring back the old ``Manuals'' directory, or perhaps just move
       each reference into its own subdirectory (which is true of tagset and
       api references now).

  <li> <b>Bug</b> The FAQ documents are <em>totally</em> out of date. <br>

</ol>

<h2><a name="other">Other</a></h2>

<ol>
  <li> <b>Bug</b> GIF conversion <br>
       Need to convert all <code>.gif</code> files to <code>.jpeg</code> or
       <code>.png</code> to avoid patent entanglements.  See
       <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/gif2png/">
       www.tuxedo.org/~esr/gif2png/</a> (rpm's downloaded to
       <code>~steve/download/gif2png*</code>).

  <li> <b>Wish</b> Use PIA off-line for RiSource.org <br> Should be an example
       of off-line website management with the PIA.

  <li> <b>Note</b> Edit-in-place HTML <br>
       The right way to implement edit-in-place HTML is to use &lt;div&gt; or
       &lt;span&gt; with unique id or class attributes to mark the replacable
       sections such as headers or footers.
