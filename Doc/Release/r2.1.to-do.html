  <li> <b>Bug</b> Correct handling for attribute case <br>
       Need to case-fold attributes correctly for the tagset.  Mixed-case
       attributes need to work.

  <li> <b>Bug</b> Correct handling for character entities. <br>
       Currently they're not defined, which causes several kinds of havoc.
       If we define them, need "retain" in many cases (e.g. &amp;nbsp;).

  <li> <b>Bug</b> shouldn't split on whitespace sometimes <br>
       e.g. in &lt;from&gt;, and possibly even &lt;foreach&gt;. 

  <li> <b>Bug</b> subst bug <br>
       seems to substitute for one char to the left of the match.  This
       is either a bug in the library or a result of an old workaround (adding
       null to end of string) that may no longer be necessary.

  <li> <b>Bug</b> POST breaks when proxied through Apache. <br>
       Just spins its wheels.  Should time out.
       (1999-12-09) <br>

       <p>

  <li> 1999-12-13 <b>Bug</b> root prefixes in Site and Subsite. <br>
       Subsite needs to handle "v" and "r", passing "vroot" and "root" to the
       Site along with any prefix, like "file" and "pia", that it doesn't
       understand.
       (1999-12-09) <br>
       -- v and r want to -> -v, -r.

  <li> 1999-12-10 <b>Bug</b> tagsets not found in CLASSPATH <br>
       because they're at the top level now rather than in the package
       <code>org.risource.dps.tagset</code>.
       (1999-12-09) <br>

  <li> 1999-11-02 <b>Bug</b> Non-strict HTML parsing needed. <br>
       Need a "nonstrict" attribute in &lt;tagset&gt;. Distinguish between
       XHTML (XML) and HTMLX (HTML with eXtensions).  Need a more general way
       to get at tagset attributes. 

  <li> 1999-11-04 <b>Bug</b> Conversion of text to internal form broken. <br>
       The consequence is that STRING nodes and &lt;include&gt; URL's
       containing ampersands don't work.  It will be <em>absolutely</em>
       necessary to correctly identify the places where we want the internal
       or external form.

  <li> 1999-12-03 <b>Bug</b> parser doesn't insert &lt;/p&gt; properly <br>
       Block tags like &lt;h*&gt; and &lt;ul&gt; have to be notInside
       &lt;p&gt; for correct handling.<br>
       -- Almost certainly still buggy.  Really need to look at the DTD and do
	  it right.
       
  <li> 1999-11-08 <b>Bug</b> PropertyTable needs a handler. <br>
       Need to be able to save PropertyTable objects, and read them back in.
       This may very well replace Namespace for everything except entities.
       It should also simplify site configuration files.
       -- 1999-11-05 in progress; need tagset entry and testing.

  <li> 1999-11-08 <b>Bug</b> Need a way to construct named nodes <br>
       For example, declarations and processing instructions need both a name
       and a type.  nodeBuilder currently doesn't handle them.

  <li> 1999-11-19 <b>Bug</b> &lt;set&gt; of a namespace is broken <br>
       The &lt;set&gt; (etc.) needs to do something different in order to
       properly install the nested namespace. 

  <li> 1999-11-22 <b>Bug</b> Replace DOCTYPE's in XML <br>
       with, e.g., a &lt;DOCTYPE&gt; element / documentBuilder handler. <br>
       -- &lt;make type=DOCTYPE&gt; works just fine. 

       <p>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> XML namespace support <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Ability to re-read config files. <br>
       Mainly needs the ability to uninstall agents.  Pretty easy if we keep a
       list in the Subsite and uninstall them by object ID.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Safe version of &lt;define&gt; <br>

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Additional file prefixes in Subsite <br>
       Need access to files relative to root, vroot, and home. 

  <li> <b>Hole</b> URL-manipulation tag <br>
       something like &lt;date&gt; but for URL's.
       
  <li> <b>Impr</b> Entity and Attr should keep value in children <br>
       This would fix many problems with entities, extract, etc. -- it will
       also break some things.  It's needed for cached entities.  Entities, at
       least, should also know their tagset.  It also brings us back into DOM
       compliance, for what (little) that's worth.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> State maintenance <br>
       When a subsite's properties are changed, the changes have to be written
       out.  Concievably this could be done as a delta file, maybe even
       <code>_subsite.xci</code>, that is always read in after the
       <code>_subsite.xcf</code>.  It can even be defaulted so that, e.g.,
       agents are read only once.  Alternatively one could save only the
       properties, as a namespace.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Cached entities <br>
       Need a way to specify that certain documents are to be cached as
       entities.  This is another way to do state maintenance, giving
       finer-grained control over what's preserved and what isn't, at the
       expense of some conceptual complication for the developer. 

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Namespaces/Entities in files <br>
       A necessary part of the cached entity/state maintenance puzzle is the
       ability to put a namespace in a file (i.e. have a namespace in a system
       entity) and keep it updated.  This may be an instance of the more general
       problem of structure-modification operations inside <em>any</em> system
       entity.  The correct solution may be to write all changed entities when
       they go out of context (scope), i.e. when a TopProcessor exits.

       <p>

  <li> <b>Impr</b> Copying Documents <br>
       Want both ability to tee-off and save a proxied document, and a
       &lt;copy&gt; tag (along the lines of &lt;input&gt; and &lt;output&gt;).
       Possibly just &lt;connect&gt; with both <code>src</code> and
       <code>dst</code> attributes.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> PUT <br>
       Need the ability to create documents using PUT requests.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> TEXT tagset <br>
       Need a tagset and associated parser that simply treats files as text
       nodes. 

  <li> <b>Impr</b> HEAD, <code>IfModifiedSince</code> <br>
       It would be useful if we could support HEAD requests (for everything)
       and support the <code>IfModifiedSince</code> header for static pages.

       <p>
</ol>

<p> The following are currently low priority, since ampersands in URL's are
    working reasonably well at the moment.

<ol>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> toString for Element could use ToString <br>
       i.e. toString for element nodes could just use Copy and
       ToString -- end of story.  (Note that you can get startString by simply
       doing startNode on a ToString.  startString is no longer used outside
       of <code>dps</code>.)

  <li> <b>Impr</b> don't use toString in Output. <br>
       Conversion of nodes to external form should be done via a properly-
       parametrized set of methods that can be called by an Output, or
       directly in the Output (which is cleaner but makes it impossible to
       have specialized elements).<br>

       Parameters should include indent, line width, etc.  Possibly give the
       nodes access to <code>write</code>, etc. in a subclass of Output.
       Output formatting is a time sink; we don't have to get it exactly right
       the first time.  The important thing is not to rely on toString for
       converting NodeList's and AttrList's.

  <li> <b>Impr</b> clean way of putting node lists on outputs. <br>
       It would be convenient if there was a simple way to put a list onto an
       Output.  Probably a method on ActiveNodeList would be best.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Can't make (nodeBuilder) or parse arbitrary decl's. <br>
       basically need to fix constructor for TreeDecl.
       
</ol>

<h2><a name="doc">Documentation</a></h2>

<ol>
  <li> <b>Impr</b> Separate tutorials and references <br>
       Possibly bring back the old ``Manuals'' directory, or perhaps just move
       each reference into its own subdirectory (which is true of tagset and
       api references now).

  <li> <b>Bug</b> The FAQ documents are <em>totally</em> out of date. <br>

</ol>

<h2><a name="other">Other</a></h2>

<ol>
  <li> 1999-12-09 <b>Hole</b> Move tagsets <br>
       Probably to PIA/lib, PIA/Tagsets, or PIA/lib/tagsets.  Might be
       worthwhile adding lib to CLASSPATH to keep resource stuff working.
       Possibly subdirs for <code>pia</code> and <code>dps</code> tagsets.
       <br>
       -- Combination of PIA/lib (for basic, etc.) and PIA/Tagsets.

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Find places for mini-apps <br>
       There are two kinds: PIA apps (for which Samples is the cannonical
       location), and <code>process</code> apps -- need a good place for the
       latter.  Possibly <code>bin</code> for scripts and <code>lib</code> for
       tagsets. 

  <li> <b>Hole</b> Move CVS tree outside firewall, tunnel server. <br>
       This has to be done in order to give outside developers access.  It's
       probably simpler to use <code>ssh</code> to tunnel the CVS password
       server's port through the firewall, but more egalitarian to move the
       server outside.

  <li> 1999-11-05 <b>Bug</b> GIF conversion <br>
       Need to convert all <code>.gif</code> files to <code>.jpeg</code> or
       <code>.png</code> to avoid patent entanglements.  See
       <a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/gif2png/">
       www.tuxedo.org/~esr/gif2png/</a> (rpm's downloaded to
       <code>~steve/download/gif2png*</code>).
       -- As of 11/4 the only GIF's left are in Doc/API/javadoc/images; these
	  came from Sun.  To fix these we'd have to rejigger the extension
	  mapping so that .gif's came out as text/png.<br>
       -- Older browsers don't seem to handle transparent PNG's, so I hacked
	  the background for the RiSource.org logo.  This may have destroyed
	  the transparency for browsers that <em>do</em> support it.  All the
	  PIA logo's had a white background, so they're still OK.

  <li> <b>Wish</b> Use <code>process</code> for RiSource.org <br>
       Should be an example of off-line website management with the PIA.
