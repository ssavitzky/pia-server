<h2><A NAME="announce">Release Announcements</A></h2>
<h3>Release 1.1 Alpha</h3>
<p>

The PIA group is pleased to announce the minor upgrade of the Information
Agency.  The Information Agency is a proxy web server (implemented in Java)
that provides an environment for document processing agents.  This release
includes security authentication, Template agent for generating new agents, and
an implementation of PUT request.

<p>

We recommend that interested users start by installing and running their own
Personal Information Agency.  (See the <a href="../Manuals/Install">
Installation manual</a> for instructions.)
Once the agency is running, you can view further documentation and try
customizing the demonstration agents.

<h3><A NAME="newfeatures">New Features</A></h3>
<h4>Security Authentication</h4>
<dl>
  <dt>  Security authorization
  <dd>  If a password file as the value of the "authentication"
	option of an agent,  the agent will request basic authentication
	before returning InterForms to the user.  The user name will be
	available as the AuthenticatedUser feature on a transaction.
  <dt>    digital signatures
  <dd>  the hash and sign tags can be used to create and verify digital
	signatures and manage public/private key collections.   Because they
	use JDK1.2 features, these handlers must be compiled by hand and
	explicitly loaded (not a part of the standard tag set).
</dl>
<h4>Template Agent</h4>

The <a href="/Template">Template</a> agent can be used for quickly
constructing the files necessary for a new Agent.  You can install it using
the form in <a href="/PIA/Agents/Template">/PIA/Agents/Template</a>.<p>

At the moment, only the Agent template really works, and it's rather slow.
It can be very useful nevertheless.  Developers might find the implementation
of interest, since it illustrates the use of load-on-demand tagsets and forms
built dynamically out of XML (well, almost) data files.<p>


<h4>PUT request</h4>
PUT request is implemented, allowing agents to store documents.

<h3><A NAME="missfeatures">Missing Features</A></h3>
While the core agency is stable and unlikely to change substantially, several
features have not yet been fully implemented.  Most important among these are
the security model, the InterForm methods for accessing data structure, and
the support for dynamic manipulation of "tagsets" by agents.  <p>

Templates are a work in progress, and only the template for Agent really works
at this point.


<h3><A NAME="information"> Additional Information</A></h3>
