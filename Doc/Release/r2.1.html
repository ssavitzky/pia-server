<h1>Release Notes for PIA Release 2.1</h1>

<p> <strong>Release 2.1 is not out yet.</strong>  This document is a
    place-holder.  For the list of things that still have to be done between
    r2.0 and r2.1, see <a href="r2.1.to-do.html">r2.1.to-do.html</a>.

<p> Release 2.1 is the first <strong>stable</strong> release of the PIA.

<p> We suggest that people who wish to use the PIA to develop applications but
    are not interested in being on the cutting edge wait for 2.1, but we
    believe that there are unlikely to be any <em>major</em> changes between
    the current release (2.0.7) and Release 2.1.

<p> Subscribe to <a href="mailto:PIA-announce-request@risource.org">
    PIA-announce@RiSource.org</a> to be notified of new releases.  Copies of
    the PIA can be obtained from our web site, <a
    href="http://www.RiSource.org/"> http//www.RiSource.org/PIA</a>.

<h3>Release 2.1.0</h3>

<p> <em>Watch this space</em>


<h2><a name="previous">Previous Release</a></h2>

<p> <a href="r2.0.html">Release 2.0</a> was the previous release series.

<p> Release 2.0.9 is intended to be essentially the ``beta'' version of 2.1 --
    it is unlikely that anything other than bug fixes will have been done in
    the interim.  If you have been using earlier versions of the PIA, you
    should at least look at the changes introduced since 2.0.6.
