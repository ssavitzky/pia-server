<h1>Release Notes for PIA Release 2.1</h1>

<p> Release 2.1.1 is the first <strong>stable</strong> release of the PIA.  We
    intend to keep incompatible changes to the tag language and configuration
    files to a minimum after this point, so as to provide a stable base on
    which to build applications.  We <em>do</em> expect to add <em>new</em>
    language features and new applications -- these include, in the former
    category, support for XML Namespaces, and in the latter, a complete
    small-office form-handling package.
</p>

<p> Subscribe to <a href="mailto:PIA-announce-request@risource.org">
    PIA-announce@RiSource.org</a> to be notified of new releases.  Copies of
    the PIA can be obtained from our web site, <a

<h2><a name="announce">Release Announcements</a></h2>
<h3>Release 2.1.1</h3>

<p> Release 2.1.1 is the first <strong>stable</strong> release of the PIA
    (Platform for Information Applications).  Several non-trivial applications
    have been implemented using the PIA, and at Release 2.1 it is considered
    ``ready for prime time''. 
</p>

<p> From this point, we expect that any changes made to the PIA, and
    especially to the tag language, will take the form of incremental
    improvements:  we intend for 2.1.1 to provide a stable base for
    applications.  We expect that any changes in the tag language after this
    point will be made in such a way as not to affect existing applications. 
</p>

<p> It <em>is</em> possible that noticable changes may be made in the tree
    structure of the documentation and sample applications.  Given the PIA's
    flexible site-structuring mechanism, any such changes should be easy to
    work around. 
</p>


<h4>Issues</h4>

<p> There are a few ``issues'' with 2.1.1, mainly functionality which we hoped
    would be present.  
</p>

<ol>
  <li> <strong>No support for XML namespaces.</strong> This is currently the
       biggest hole in the PIA.  We expect to add namespace support in the
       near future, but will continue to support XML without namespaces
       because many other XML applications (not just the PIA!)  still do not
       support them, either.  This includes the DOM 1.0 and SAX 1.0 API's,
       which can be expected to remain in widespread use for some time.
  </li>
  <li> <strong>No support for servlets and SAX.</strong>
  </li>
  <li> <strong>No support for DTD's.</strong>  Our parser still does not
       properly handle the internal subset of the DTD.
  </li>
  <li> Links to <code>javadoc</code>-generated class documentation are broken,
       especially in the <a href="../Doc/API/">API manual</a>.
  </li>
  <li> In addition, a small number of tags are unimplemented (for example,
       &lt;URL&gt;), and some ``xml-style'' attributes (see item 1 below) are
       unimplemented or undocumented.  Applications written using the current
       tagsets will, however, continue to function.
  </li>
</ol>

<h4>Changes since 2.0.8</h4>

<ol>
  <li> Language cleanup:
       <ul>
	 <li> <code>op="<em>operation</em>"</code> attributes for all tags
	      (e.g. &lt;test&gt;, &lt;numeric&gt;, &lt;logical&gt;) that
	      implement multiple operations.  The old operation-name
	      attributes are still available for use in documents parsed using
	      a legacy, HTML parser.
       </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Improvements to <code>tsdoc</code> tagset.  
       <ul>
	 <li> Tagset documentation can now be served on the fly from a
	      <code>.ts</code> file.
	 <li> Automatically generated TOC and tag index.
	 <li> Improved cosmetics (color, formatting).
       </ul>
  </li>
</ol>


<h2><a name="previous">Previous Release</a></h2>

<p> <a href="r2.0.html">Release 2.0</a> was the previous release series.
</p>

<p> Release 2.0.9 was, essentially, the ``beta'' version of 2.1 --
    it is unlikely that anything other than bug fixes will have been done in
    the interim.  If you have been using earlier versions of the PIA, you
    should at least look at the changes introduced since 2.0.6; 2.0.7 and to a
    lesser extent 2.0.8 introduced significant changes.
