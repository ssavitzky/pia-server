<h2>Release Announcements</h2>

<h3>Release 0.9</h3>

<pre>
<b>From:</b> Greg Wolff <wolff@crc.ricoh.com>
<b>To:</b> crc@crc.ricoh.com
<b>Subject:</b> Personal Information Agency alpha release
<b>Date:</b> Wed, 6 Aug 1997 15:55:09 -0700 (PDT)

The PIA group is pleased to announce the alpha release of the Information
Agency.  The Information Agency is a kind of proxy web server (implemented
in Java) that provides an environment for document processing agents.  A
Personal Information Agency sits between you and the rest of the web world,
providing a place for agents which can perform many kinds of tasks for you,
such as:

	   * maintain a searchable history of all documents visited
	   * filter advertisements from documents
	   * notify you of changes to interesting documents
           * Lots more cool stuff we haven't even thought of

Before getting too excited about the technology, we should emphasize that
for the alpha release we have focused primarily on the core technology--the
agency.  Most of the useful agents have yet to be written.  This release
primarily targets users interested in creating custom agents (mostly a
matter of writing html with some special extensions).  As we build a
repository of agents, future releases will provide more "out-of-box"
functionality.

CRC members are encouraged to experiment with running their own Personal
Information Agency.  We would very much appreciate feedback.

Full details for installing and running the agency can be found at
<a href="http://pia.crc.ricoh.com:8888/">http://pia.crc.ricoh.com:8888/</a>
Brief instructions appended below.

Thanks for your support,
The PIA Group (Greg, Steve, Rithy)

<hr>
Alpha Release 0.9 has been tested on unix machines.  It should work on any
platform (Windows, Mac) with a Java runtime, but we have not yet developed
installation instructions for non unix platforms.


Solaris users should be able to execute the command (in /usr/local/bin):
 jpia

If all goes well, several messages will appear and you should be able to
browse to your agency at http://YOUR.HOST.NAME:8888/
(After that, you will probably want to change the proxy settings of your
browser to use your local agency as the proxy host.)

For more information, see the <a href="http://pia.crc.ricoh.com:8888/"
