<h1>Release Notes for PIA Release 2.0.2</h1>

<p> Release 2.0 is the first external open source release of the PIA.  It is
    intended for developers working on the PIA internals.  This is NOT a
    stable release: the system does work, but there are still bugs, broken
    links, and other anomalies.  Release 2.1 will be the first stable release.

<p> We suggest that persons who wish to use the PIA to develop applications
    but are not interested in debugging/programming the core engine wait for
    2.1.  Subscribe to <a href=mailto:PIA-announce-request@risource.org>
    PIA-announce@RiSource.org</a> to be notified of new releases.


<h2><A NAME="announce">Release Announcements</A></h2>
<h3>Release 2.0.2</h3>

<p>
This is the first patch to the first external open source release of the PIA.
It is <em>still</em> intended primarily for developers.  Several directories
have been moved, and a few obsolete ones have been removed.  This trend can be
expected to continue for a while.  

<p> Major changes since 2.0.1A:

<ul>
  <li> The Java directory structure has been revised to conform to current
       naming conventions. What was once <code>src/java/crc</code> is now
       <code>src/java/org/risource</code>.  The RegEx package and the subset
       of the Jigsaw classes that we are actually using have been brought up
       to date and moved to their proper places in the package hierarchy.

  <li> CVS ID's had lost their all-important <code>$Id: r2.0.html,v 1.10 1999-03-13 16:27:38 wolff Exp $</code> due to an
       ill-advised ``export''.  They're back.

  <li> HTML document types now refer to the correct public identifier,<br>
       "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN".  It is possible (likely?) that
       some documents do not validate yet.  The document types in
       <code>.xh</code> files are passed through the document processor
       unmodified, so they refer to the DTD of the <em>output</em>, not of the
       input file.  This will change so that the document types are properly
       set by the processor (<code>.xh</code> files will have XML DTD's
       corresponding to the "tagsets" that they use.  Output files will have
       their document types set appropriately -- usually HTML.)  Also, we
       recommend that any <code>.xh</code> files you create adhere to the XML
       spec (quoted attribute values, include all end tags, etc.)  Even though
       our processor will accept a wider range of (SGML) document syntax,
       using well formed XML will make it easier for you to process your
       <code>.xh</code> files with other tools should you choose to do so.  We
       are in the process of converting all of our examples to strictly
       conform to the spec.

  <li> The Toolbar, History, and Cache agents, all of which operate by
       proxying through the PIA, have been gathered underneath the (new)
       ``Proxie'' agent.  The agent namespace still isn't right, but this is
       at least useable.  If you made yourself a custom START-UP.html file,
       make a new one.  Proxie is poorly-documented at the moment.  Your
       browsing history (in <a href="/~History">/~History</a>) will be
       unaffected by these and future changes. 

  <li> The obsolete directories <code>Agents/Logo</code> and
       <code>Doc/Graphics</code> have been removed.

  <li> Property names (stored in <code>Config/pia.props</code> now start with
       <code>pia.</code> instead of <code> crc.pia. </code>.

  <li> The interface <code>org.risource.Version</code> has been added to
       contain version-number constants.  Running <code>pia -version</code>
       prints out the version string.
</ul>



<h3>Release 2.0.1A</h3>
<p>

This is the first external open source release of the PIA.  It is
intended for developers working on the PIA internals.  This is NOT a stable
release -- the system does work, but many links are broken due to code changes
made in preparing for the external release.  Release 2.1 will be the first
stable release.   We suggest that persons who wish to use the PIA to develop
applications but are not interested in debugging/programming the core engine
wait for 2.1.  Subscribe to <a href=mailto:PIA-announce-request@risource.org>
PIA-announce@RiSource.org</a> to be notified of new releases.

<p>

<p>
We recommend starting by installing and running your own
copy of the PIA.  (See the <a href="../install.html">
Installation manual</a> for instructions.)
Once the agency is running, you can view further documentation and try
customizing the demonstration agents.

<h3><A NAME="newfeatures">New Features</A></h3>
<h4>Document Processing System</h4>

<p>The Document Processing System is a completely new rewrite of the PIA's
extension language for active HTML and XML documents.  The parser can handle
both HTML and XML, and the internal data structures are compliant with the <a
href="http://www.w3c.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a>'s
<a href="http://www.w3c.org/DOM/">Document Object Model</a> standard.

<p>Details can be found in the <a href="../Manuals/Api/internals.html">API Manual</a>, and of
course in the <a href="../../src/java/crc/dps">source code</a>.
<p>

<h4>New Tag Language</h4>

<p>The extension programming language used to write active documents
(Interforms) has been almost completely revised, and considerably simplified.
Details can be found in the  <a href="../tagsets.html"> Pia Tagsets
Manual.</a>. 

<dl>
  <dt> <b>Note:</b>
  <dd> As of this release, some of the new tags are still unimplemented.
  A list of unimplemented tags, along with some known bugs, and desirable
  enhancements can be found on the <a href="../../src/java/crc/dps/to-do.html">to-do list</a>.
</dl>
<p>

You will notice that are classes/package names are prefixed with crc.  This stands for California
Research Center.  We are considering changing the prefix to org.risource.


<h4>Miscellaneous items</h4>

In preparing the code for external release, several obsolete packages were
removed.  Some of these packages are referenced in the test code and may lead
to error messages when doing a full make.  You can safely ignore these
messages.
<p>
Small pieces of a few external packages are used in places by the PIA software
(Jigsaw,Jcrypt, regexp).  
Thanks to Anselm, John Dumans, Shugo Maeda, and the others who have
contributed their software to the community.
These are provided as libraries in PIA/lib/java.
The source for the regexp package can be retrieved from
ftp://ftp.risource.org/pub/regex-0_11.tgz


<p> The current version of the DOM that we use is not the latest (we are
    hoping to upgrade soon.)  The interface classes provided by the W3C for
    the version we are using is  PIA/src/java/w3c.  The latest
    version (which is incompatible with our current implementation) is
    available from the <a href=http://www.w3c.org/> W3C</a>.
