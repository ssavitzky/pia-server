<h1>Release Notes for PIA Release 2.0</h1>

<p> Release 2.0 is the first external open source release of the PIA.  It is
    intended for developers working on the PIA internals.  This is NOT a
    stable release: the system does work, but there are still bugs, broken
    links, and other anomalies.  Release 2.1 will be the first stable release.

<p> We suggest that people who wish to use the PIA to develop applications
    but are not interested in debugging/programming the core engine wait for
    2.1.  Subscribe to <a href="mailto:PIA-announce-request@risource.org">
    PIA-announce@RiSource.org</a> to be notified of new releases.


<h2><A NAME="announce">Release Announcements</A></h2>
<h3>Release 2.0.5</h3>

<p> This release includes the ability to save and restore Agent state in XML
    files.  At this point it is probably stable enough for someone willing to
    put up with the still-sketchy documentation to start building an
    application.

<h4>Changes since 2.0.4:</h4>

<ol>
  <li> Release 2.0.5a includes more complete javadoc coverage and fewer
       javadoc errors.

  <li> The &lt;AGENT&gt; tag has been implemented in the PIA, allowing entire
       agents, and even groups of agents, to be saved in XML files and read
       back.  This has the side-effects of both simplifying and speeding up
       start-up.  It also ensures that agents are installed in a user-defined
       sequence. 

  <li> The old-style agent checkpoint files, and the default <code><a
       href="/Admin/START-UP.html">Admin/START-UP.html</a></code>, have been
       eliminated.  If you have a customized <code>START-UP.html</code> file,
       however, it will run as usual.  Browse to your new or customized
       agents' <code>options</code> pages, and use the <b>Save Options</b>
       form to write the XML data into files called <code>AGENT.xml</code> in
       the appropriate user directories.  Then use the <b>Save agent file
       list</b> button on either <a href="/Admin/control">/Admin/control</a>
       or <a href="/Admin/load-agent">/Admin/load-agent</a> to add the agent
       to the list of known agents.
       <!-- === this will probably change before release. === -->
       At some point there will be an option to save the file
       list automatically when appropriate.

  <li> There were two reasons for dropping the old checkpoint files, which
       were implemented as serialized Java objects.  One is that they're not
       robust across changes in the classes.  The other is that it turns out
       that reading and writing XML files is faster.  Serialized tagsets
       (<code>.tso</code> files) have been dropped for the same reason.

  <li> The <code>options</code> form has been significantly enhanced, as has
       the <a href="/Admin/configure">/Admin/configure</a> form.  A new form,
       <a href="/Admin/control">/Admin/control</a>, has been added to perform
       immediate configuration changes. 

  <li> The &lt;namespace&gt; and &lt;bind&gt; tags have been added; these
       allow arbitrary collections of name-value pairs to be saved in and
       restored from files.

  <li> The parser has been sped up by roughly a factor of two, mainly by going
       to a <code>BufferedReader</code> for input.  Combined with XML agent
       loading and the ``stripped'' version of <code>basic.ts</code> (which is
       now built by default, and gives an additional factor of two), this
       makes initialization <em>significantly</em> faster.

  <li> The ubiquitous PIA logo in the page heading is now linked to "/"
       (<code>your</code> PIA's home page) instead of to <a
       href="www.RiSource.org">www.RiSource.org</a> as it used to be.
       Explicit links to <a href="www.RiSource.org">www.RiSource.org</a> are
       now provided in the heading and footer.  Entities are used to ensure
       consistent use of fonts and colors for the logo.

  <li> Bugs in &lt;logical and&gt;, &lt;text trim&gt;, and &lt;extract&gt;
       have been fixed.
</ol>

<h3>Release 2.0.4</h3>

<p> This release marks some major improvements in DOM compatibility, plus a
    number of bug fixes.

<h4>Changes since 2.0.3:</h4>

<ol>
  <li> The internal representation for parse trees in
       <code>org.risource.dps</code> is now fully compliant to the interfaces
       (though not yet all of the behavior) of the current version of the <a
       href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>'s Document Object Model, as specified
       in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/"
       >REC-DOM-Level-1-19981001</a>.

  <li> The local extensions to the DOM interfaces can be found in the <a
       href="../../src/java/org/risource/dps/active/"
       >org.risource.dps.active</a> package; the implementation classes are in
       <a href="../../src/java/org/risource/dps/tree/"
       >org.risource.dps.tree</a>.  A local copy of the DOM Java bindings can
       be found in <a href="../../src/java/org/w3c/dom/" >org.w3c.dom</a>; the
       old version of the DOM interfaces has been removed.

  <li> A number of bugs introduced in 2.0.3 by the new agent naming scheme
       have been fixed.  Most of these had been manifested as broken links in
       agent code.  Item 4. in release 2.0.3 (below) proved remarkably
       prescient. 

  <li> A few minor improvements to the tag language have been made, most
       notably the &lt;insert&gt; sub-element of &lt;extract&gt;.

  <li> A bug in setting the content length header for proxied pages has been
       modified has been patched.  Using the PIA as a proxy with the toolbars
       turned on should no longer cause problems with pages getting truncated.

  <li> The unix batch files in PIA/bin (pia, process, pia_wrapper) have been
       modified to work properly with or without having a classpath setting.  
       (Without a classpath, it's best run with PIA/src/java as your current
       directory.)
       The Windows batch file PIA/bin/pia.bat (piajdk.bat no longer needed) 
       no longer touches classpath, but changes directory to PIA/src/java and runs
       from there.  (It may still be necessary to change the properties of
       your DOS box to enable more environment variables.)
</ol>

<h3>Release 2.0.3</h3>

<p> This is the second patch to Release 2.0; things are beginning to
    stabilize.

<p> Changes since 2.0.2:

<ol>
  <li> It is now possible to ``mount'' an Agent anywhere in the URL hierarchy.
  <li> An Agent's home, user, and data directories can be specified
       separately.  Directories can be specified relative to any of several
       different roots.
  <li> The output of the DPS is now almost totally XML-compliant.  The
       <code>process -n</code> command can be used to bring random files into
       compliance; this has been done with all <code>.xh</code> and
       <code>.ts</code>files in the PIA.
  <li> Most (we dare not hope for ``all'') of the broken links have been
       fixed. 
  <li> Obsolete test code has been removed from org/risource/dps/test,
       org/risource/test/dom, ds, and pia subdirectories. </li>
  <li> Pages have been added to the Demo agent to illustrate use of the
       debug and output handlers. </li>
  <li> Precompiled zip and jar files have been removed from $PIA_DIR/lib.  
       All classes are now accessed through the $PIA_DIR/src/java path.  
       Also, due to Makefile changes, it is no longer necessary to add 
       this path to your CLASSPATH. </li>
  <li> A list of known bugs has been added to www.risource.org.  It is accessed
       from the PIA page, known bugs link.</li>
  <li> The PIA namespace has been made available so that the PIA
       properties listed in the pia.props file are now accessible to agents.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Release 2.0.2</h3>

<p>
This is the first patch to the first external open source release of the PIA.
It is <em>still</em> intended primarily for developers.  Several directories
have been moved, and a few obsolete ones have been removed.  This trend can be
expected to continue for a while.  

<p> Major changes since 2.0.1A:

<ul>
  <li> The Java directory structure has been revised to conform to current
       naming conventions. What was once <code>src/java/crc</code> is now
       <code>src/java/org/risource</code>.  The RegEx package and the subset
       of the Jigsaw classes that we are actually using have been brought up
       to date and moved to their proper places in the package hierarchy.

  <li> CVS ID's had lost their all-important <code>$</code><code>Id:...$</code>
       due to an ill-advised ``export''.  They're back.

  <li> HTML document types now refer to the correct public identifier,<br>
       "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN".  It is possible (likely?) that
       some documents do not validate yet.  The document types in
       <code>.xh</code> files are passed through the document processor
       unmodified, so they refer to the DTD of the <em>output</em>, not of the
       input file.  This will change so that the document types are properly
       set by the processor (<code>.xh</code> files will have XML DTD's
       corresponding to the "tagsets" that they use.  Output files will have
       their document types set appropriately -- usually HTML.)  Also, we
       recommend that any <code>.xh</code> files you create adhere to the XML
       spec (quoted attribute values, include all end tags, etc.)  Even though
       our processor will accept a wider range of (SGML) document syntax,
       using well formed XML will make it easier for you to process your
       <code>.xh</code> files with other tools should you choose to do so.  We
       are in the process of converting all of our examples to strictly
       conform to the spec.

  <li> The Toolbar, History, and Cache agents, all of which operate by
       proxying through the PIA, have been gathered underneath the (new)
       ``Proxie'' agent.  The agent namespace still isn't right, but this is
       at least useable.  If you made yourself a custom START-UP.html file,
       make a new one.  Proxie is poorly-documented at the moment.  Your
       browsing history (in <a href="/~History">/~History</a>) will be
       unaffected by these and future changes. 

  <li> The obsolete directories <code>Agents/Logo</code> and
       <code>Doc/Graphics</code> have been removed.

  <li> Property names (stored in <code>Config/pia.props</code> now start with
       <code>pia.</code> instead of <code> crc.pia. </code>.

  <li> The interface <code>org.risource.Version</code> has been added to
       contain version-number constants.  Running <code>pia -version</code>
       prints out the version string.
</ul>



<h3>Release 2.0.1A</h3>
<p>

This is the first external open source release of the PIA.  It is
intended for developers working on the PIA internals.  This is NOT a stable
release -- the system does work, but many links are broken due to code changes
made in preparing for the external release.  Release 2.1 will be the first
stable release.   We suggest that persons who wish to use the PIA to develop
applications but are not interested in debugging/programming the core engine
wait for 2.1.  Subscribe to <a href="mailto:PIA-announce-request@risource.org">
PIA-announce@RiSource.org</a> to be notified of new releases.

<p>

<p>
We recommend starting by installing and running your own
copy of the PIA.  (See the <a href="../install.html">
Installation manual</a> for instructions.)
Once the agency is running, you can view further documentation and try
customizing the demonstration agents.

<h3><A NAME="newfeatures">New Features</A></h3>
<h4>Document Processing System</h4>

<p>The Document Processing System is a completely new rewrite of the PIA's
extension language for active HTML and XML documents.  The parser can handle
both HTML and XML, and the internal data structures are compliant with the <a
href="http://www.w3c.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a>'s
<a href="http://www.w3c.org/DOM/">Document Object Model</a> standard.

<p>Details can be found in the <a href="../API/internals.html">Internals
Manual</a>, and of 
course in the <a href="../../src/java/crc/dps">source code</a>.
<p>

<h4>New Tag Language</h4>

<p>The extension programming language used to write active documents
(Interforms) has been almost completely revised, and considerably simplified.
Details can be found in the  <a href="../tagsets.html"> Pia Tagsets
Manual.</a>. 

<dl>
  <dt> <b>Note:</b>
  <dd> As of this release, some of the new tags are still unimplemented.
       A list of unimplemented tags, along with some known bugs, and desirable
       enhancements can be found on the
       <a href="../../src/java/crc/dps/to-do.html">to-do list</a>.
</dl>
<p>

<p> You will notice that are classes/package names are prefixed with crc.
    This stands for California Research Center.  We are considering changing
    the prefix to org.risource. 


<h4>Miscellaneous items</h4>

<p>In preparing the code for external release, several obsolete packages were
removed.  Some of these packages are referenced in the test code and may lead
to error messages when doing a full make.  You can safely ignore these
messages.
<p>
Small pieces of a few external packages are used in places by the PIA software
(Jigsaw,Jcrypt, regexp).  
Thanks to Anselm, John Dumans, Shugo Maeda, and the others who have
contributed their software to the community.
These are provided as libraries in PIA/lib/java.
The source for the regexp package can be retrieved from
ftp://ftp.risource.org/pub/regex-0_11.tgz


<p> The current version of the DOM that we use is not the latest (we are
    hoping to upgrade soon.)  The interface classes provided by the W3C for
    the version we are using is  PIA/src/java/w3c.  The latest
    version (which is incompatible with our current implementation) is
    available from the <a href=http://www.w3c.org/> W3C</a>.
