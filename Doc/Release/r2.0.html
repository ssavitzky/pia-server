<h2><A NAME="announce">Release Announcements</A></h2>
<h3>Release 2.0</h3>
<p>

This is the first external open source release of the PIA.  It is
intended for developers.
<p>

We recommend that interested users start by installing and running their own
Personal Information Agency.  (See the <a href="../install.html">
Installation manual</a> for instructions.)
Once the agency is running, you can view further documentation and try
customizing the demonstration agents.

<h3><A NAME="newfeatures">New Features</A></h3>
<h4>Document Processing System</h4>

<p>The Document Processing System is a completely new rewrite of the PIA's
extension language for active HTML and XML documents.  The parser can handle
both HTML and XML, and the internal data structures are compliant with the <a
href="http://www.w3c.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a>'s
<a href="http://www.w3c.org/DOM/">Document Object Model</a> standard.

<p>Details can be found in the <a href="../Manuals/Api">API Manual</a>, and of
course in the <a href="../../src/java/crc/dps">source code</a>.
<p>

<h4>New Tag Language</h4>

<p>The extension programming language used to write active documents
(Interforms) has been almost completely revised, and considerably simplified.
Details can be found in the  <a href="../tagsets.html"> Pia Tagsets
Manual.</a>. 

<dl>
  <dt> <b>Note:</b>
  <dd> As of this release, some of the new tags are still unimplemented.
  A list of unimplemented tags, along with some known bugs, and desirable
  enhancements can be found on the <a href="../../src/java/crc/dps/to-do.html">to-do list</a>.
</dl>
<p>

You will notice that are classes are prefixed with crc.  This stands for California
Research Center.
