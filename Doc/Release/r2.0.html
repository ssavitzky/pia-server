<h1>Release Notes for PIA Release 2.0</h1>

<p> Release 2.0 is the first external open source release of the PIA.  It is
    intended for developers working on the PIA internals.  This is NOT a
    stable release: the system does work, but there are still bugs, broken
    links, and other anomalies.  Release 2.1 will be the first stable release.

<p> We suggest that people who wish to use the PIA to develop applications but
    are not interested in being on the cutting edge wait for 2.1, but we
    believe that there are unlikely to be any <em>major</em> changes between
    the current release (2.0.7) and Release 2.1.

<p> Subscribe to <a href="mailto:PIA-announce-request@risource.org">
    PIA-announce@RiSource.org</a> to be notified of new releases.


<h2><a name="announce">Release Announcements</a></h2>
<h3>Release 2.0.7 (Storm Warnings!)</h3>

<p> This release incorporates the changes that were foreshadowed in 2.0.6.
    <em>If you have been developing agents, they will need to be fixed!</em>

<p> We expect to be moving <em>very</em> quickly toward a 2.1 release after
    this; if you know of any show-stoppers this would be a good time to
    mention them.  The plan from here:

<ul>
  <li> <b>2.0.8</b> -- in a week or two:<br>
       expect a prioritized list of things to be fixed before 2.1.
       
  <li> <b>2.0.9</b> -- feature freeze:<br>
       Only (major) bug fixes between here and 2.1.
</ul>

<h4>Changes since 2.0.6</h4>

<ol>
  <li> The PIA has gone from having essentially two major components (the
       <code><a href="../../src/java/org/risource/pia/">pia</a></code> server
       engine and the <code><a
       href="../../src/java/org/risource/dps/">dps</a></code> Document
       Processing System) to three, adding the <code><a
       href="../../src/java/org/risource/site/">site</a></code> Site Resource
       Package.  You can get a summary and overview by reading:
       <ol>
	 <li> <a href="../../src/java/org/risource/pia/about.html">About the
	      PIA Core Engine</a> in the
	      <a href="../../src/java/org/risource/pia/">org.risource.pia</a>
	      package.
	 <li> <a href="../../src/java/org/risource/site/about.html">About the
	      Site Resource Package</a> in the
	      <a href="../../src/java/org/risource/site/">org.risource.site</a>
	      package.
	 <li> <a href="../Notes/steve/naming.html">Notes on Naming</a> in
	      <a href="../Notes/steve/">Steve's notes</a>
       </ol>
  <li> The main change, and it's a big one, is that Agents no longer play a
       role in mapping URL's onto files.  The Site Resource Package does that
       now.  Although each Agent still has a ``home directory'', accessible as
       <code>~<em>name</em></code>, this is the <em>only</em> directory
       associated with the agent.  Its data directory is simply a subdirectory
       of its home directory.
  <li> The old hack whereby a URL like <code>/Agent</code> got you a home page
       while <code>/Agent/</code> (with a trailing slash) got you a generic
       index is gone.  The generic index is still around, but it has its own
       name now.  The trailing slash on directory names is back to being
       optional, and just as with most servers you will save yourself a
       redirection if you use it.
  <li> The DOFS agent is gone.  In its place is a much simpler, but far more
       flexible, technique that allows symbolic links (aliases) to be
       positioned anywhere in the URL tree.  These links make it much easier
       to incorporate pages, and agents, from elsewhere in the filesystem into
       a working PIA.  There is no longer any need to develop agents or
       applications in your <code>$HOME/.pia</code> directory and later move
       them to <code>PIA/Agents</code>.
  <li> The other agents that were nothing but placeholders in URL space are
       also gone, since there is no need for a top-level directory to
       correspond to an agent.
  <li> The default top-level directory for a PIA-based server is the PIA
       directory itself, which eliminates a lot of aliasing and other
       problems.  Of course, nothing prevents a PIA-based application from
       having a totally different root directory; that's <em>also</em> a lot
       simpler to do than it used to be.  There is a mechanism that allows the
       entire PIA directory to remain accessible to XHMTL pages while hiding
       as much of it as necessary from the browser.
  <li> The old <code>Agents</code> directory is still around; it really ought
       to be called ``Agents and Other Applications'', but the old name just
       <em>sounds better</em>, and besides the line between agents and other
       applications is pretty fuzzy.  We could have renamed it
       ``<code>Apps</code>'' but that would have broken many things.
  <li> The user root directory (<code>$HOME/.pia</code> on a Unix system) is
       no longer called ``<code>/~/</code>'', but it's still around.  It
       contains a sort of ``shadow tree'' that parallels the PIA's main
       directory tree rooted at PIA.  Shadow directories and files are created
       on demand; all writes take place in the user directory tree.  This
       provides an explicit mechanism that supports putting the PIA
       distribution tree on a read-only medium such as a CD-ROM.
  <li> The old way of referring to the History agent's data directory was
       <code>/~/History</code>; it was located in  <code>.pia/History</code>.
       User-modified forms for the History agent were located, confusingly, in
       <code>.pia/Agents/Proxie/History</code>.  Now, the History agent's data
       directory is referred to as <code>/~History/DATA</code> and is located
       in <code>.pia/Agents/Proxie/History/DATA</code>, where one would expect
       to find it.

       <p>The following shell commands can be used to move your history on a
       Unix machine:
<pre>
      cd ~/.pia
      mkdir Agents/Proxie/History
      mv History Agents/Proxie/History/DATA
</pre>       

       <p>A more elaborate script can be found in <a
       href="../../src/app/tools/move-history-data"> 
       <code>PIA/src/app/tools/move-history-data</code></a> in case you start
       using the new PIA before realizing that your history data ought to have
       been moved first.

  <li> An arbitrary amount of XML metadata can be associated with resources
       (files or directories), using per-directory XML configuration files
       with the default name of <code>_subsite.xcf</code>.  This will
       eventually be used to support <a
       href="http://www.webdav.org/">WebDAV</a> ``properties''and similar
       things.  Naturally, agents are <em>already</em> included in this
       metadata.
  <li> The entire PIA configuration can be specified in a single ``site
       configuration file'', which can be located anywhere.  Multiple views of
       the same directory tree are possible, and several examples are provided
       in the <code><a href="../../Config/Site">Config/Site</a></code>
       directory.
  <li> An Agent is no longer a Namespace -- the implementation is
       <em>much</em> simpler now.  The old <code>&amp;AGENT:;</code> construct
       is still around, but refers to the agent's attribute list.  Most things
       that used to be entities in the agent's namespace are now files (still
       capable of being referred to as entities) in the agent's home
       directory.
  <li> The PIA's command line has been substantially overhauled; it now takes
       a pathname, which can be either the root directory or the top-level
       configuration file.  Everything else can be configured in the top-level
       configuration file, although it is still possible to override the more
       common items (e.g. port) on the command line.
</ol>

<p> The net effect is that the PIA's core engine has undergone a tectonic
    shift from being a collection of agents that somehow managed to function
    as a web server, to being a web server that does a pretty good job of
    playing host to a collection of agents.  Removing the tight coupling
    between URL-space naming and agents has improved both the server and the
    agents. 

<h4>Known Problems</h4>

<p> Because of the extent of the changes in this release, many things are
    still broken.  If you have been relying on a PIA application to get your
    other work done, please save a copy of your current working directory and
    put it someplace safe!

<ol>
  <li> Several old agents have not even been looked at, especially
       <code>BugReport</code>, <code>View</code>, and
       <code>Proxie/fileTools</code>.  The non-Agent applications
       <code>Tutorial</code> and <code>Demo</code> are working,
       blissfully unaware of the changes that whirl around them.
  <li> Lots of pages in agents that <em>are</em> working (after a fashion) are
       still full of broken links and obsolete code.  Many pages.  These
       include <code>Admin</code>, <code>Proxie</code>, <code>Proxie</code>'s
       sub-agents.  
  <li> The ``help'' pages are almost totally broken at this point.
  <li> Much of the documentation needs to be rewritten, including large parts
       of 
       <ol>
	 <li>  <a href="../author.html"><code>author.html</code></a>
	 <li>  <a href="../entities.html"><code>entities.html</code></a>
	 <li>  <a href="../intro.html"><code>intro.html</code></a>
       </ol>
       This is in progress.
  <li> There is no good way to list or access files in directories under a
       specific (real or virtual) root; they are all merged at the moment.
  <li> Agent initialization is somewhat broken -- it happens when you first
       enter a directory.  It really needs to be done recursively up front.
</ol>


<h3>Release 2.0.6</h3>

<p> This release includes a slightly-revised language that is more readable
    and totally XML-compliant.  In addition, several of the interfaces have
    been cleaned up, and extended to the point where the DPS can be dropped
    into any SAX or DOM application as a document-processing extension.

<p> A significant upheaval in the way URL's are mapped onto files, and a total
    rethinking of the role of agents, is in progress.  Preliminary notes and
    code exist (see item 1 below) but have not yet been integrated with the
    PIA as a whole.

<h4>Changes since 2.0.5:</h4>

<ol>
  <li> Added new <a href="../Notes/steve/naming.html">notes on naming</a>,
       including design notes toward a radical change in the way URL's,
       files, and agents interrelate.  Preliminary source code can be
       found in the <code>org.risource.site</code> package.
  <li> Added a sizeable number of new demonstrations, in the
       <code>Tutorial</code> agent.
  <li> Added methods to the <code>org.risource.dps.Output</code> interface
       that don't start with a DOM node (one is constructed if necessary).
       This makes it easy to drive an Output from, e.g., a SAX driver.
  <li> Added the <code>org.risource.dps.output.ToProcessor</code> class, an
       Output that drives a Processor.  This makes it easy to drive the DPS
       from any event-driven parser, e.g. SAX, by writing a trivial adapter
       class. 
  <li> Eliminated the need for entities as variables, clearing the way for use
       with SGML and XML parsers, most of which substitute entities ``up
       front''.  Entities defined in a document's environment, e.g. PIA: and
       the tagset, will still work and will behave like ``traditional''
       entities.  For the moment, it <em>also</em> still works to access
       variables using entities.
  <li> Central to eliminating entities is a new tag, &lt;element&gt; (or,
       equivalently, &lt;E&gt;), for constructing an element and then
       processing it. 
  <li> Most tags have been extended to take XML-style attributes as well as
       HTML-style ones (for example, &lt;numeric op="add"&gt; instead of
       &lt;numeric add="add"&gt;). 
  <li> The DPS (Document Processing System) can now be used with any DOM or
       SAX implementation.
</ol>

<h3>Release 2.0.5</h3>

<p> This release includes the ability to save and restore Agent state in XML
    files.  At this point it is probably stable enough for someone willing to
    put up with the still-sketchy documentation to start building an
    application.

<h4>Changes since 2.0.4:</h4>

<ol>
  <li> Release 2.0.5a includes more complete javadoc coverage and fewer
       javadoc errors.

  <li> The &lt;AGENT&gt; tag has been implemented in the PIA, allowing entire
       agents, and even groups of agents, to be saved in XML files and read
       back.  This has the side-effects of both simplifying and speeding up
       start-up.  It also ensures that agents are installed in a user-defined
       sequence. 

  <li> The old-style agent checkpoint files, and the default <code><a
       href="/Admin/START-UP.html">Admin/START-UP.html</a></code>, have been
       eliminated.  If you have a customized <code>START-UP.html</code> file,
       however, it will run as usual.  Browse to your new or customized
       agents' <code>options</code> pages, and use the <b>Save Options</b>
       form to write the XML data into files called <code>AGENT.xml</code> in
       the appropriate user directories.  Then use the <b>Save agent file
       list</b> button on either <a href="/Admin/control">/Admin/control</a>
       or <a href="/Admin/load-agent">/Admin/load-agent</a> to add the agent
       to the list of known agents.
       <!-- === this will probably change before release. === -->
       At some point there will be an option to save the file
       list automatically when appropriate.

  <li> There were two reasons for dropping the old checkpoint files, which
       were implemented as serialized Java objects.  One is that they're not
       robust across changes in the classes.  The other is that it turns out
       that reading and writing XML files is faster.  Serialized tagsets
       (<code>.tso</code> files) have been dropped for the same reason.

  <li> The <code>options</code> form has been significantly enhanced, as has
       the <a href="/Admin/configure">/Admin/configure</a> form.  A new form,
       <a href="/Admin/control">/Admin/control</a>, has been added to perform
       immediate configuration changes. 

  <li> The &lt;namespace&gt; and &lt;bind&gt; tags have been added; these
       allow arbitrary collections of name-value pairs to be saved in and
       restored from files.

  <li> The parser has been sped up by roughly a factor of two, mainly by going
       to a <code>BufferedReader</code> for input.  Combined with XML agent
       loading and the ``stripped'' version of <code>basic.ts</code> (which is
       now built by default, and gives an additional factor of two), this
       makes initialization <em>significantly</em> faster.

  <li> The ubiquitous PIA logo in the page heading is now linked to "/"
       (<code>your</code> PIA's home page) instead of to <a
       href="www.RiSource.org">www.RiSource.org</a> as it used to be.
       Explicit links to <a href="www.RiSource.org">www.RiSource.org</a> are
       now provided in the heading and footer.  Entities are used to ensure
       consistent use of fonts and colors for the logo.

  <li> Bugs in &lt;logical and&gt;, &lt;text trim&gt;, and &lt;extract&gt;
       have been fixed.
</ol>

<h3>Release 2.0.4</h3>

<p> This release marks some major improvements in DOM compatibility, plus a
    number of bug fixes.

<h4>Changes since 2.0.3:</h4>

<ol>
  <li> The internal representation for parse trees in
       <code>org.risource.dps</code> is now fully compliant to the interfaces
       (though not yet all of the behavior) of the current version of the <a
       href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a>'s Document Object Model, as specified
       in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-DOM-Level-1/"
       >REC-DOM-Level-1-19981001</a>.

  <li> The local extensions to the DOM interfaces can be found in the <a
       href="../../src/java/org/risource/dps/active/"
       >org.risource.dps.active</a> package; the implementation classes are in
       <a href="../../src/java/org/risource/dps/tree/"
       >org.risource.dps.tree</a>.  A local copy of the DOM Java bindings can
       be found in <a href="../../src/java/org/w3c/dom/" >org.w3c.dom</a>; the
       old version of the DOM interfaces has been removed.

  <li> A number of bugs introduced in 2.0.3 by the new agent naming scheme
       have been fixed.  Most of these had been manifested as broken links in
       agent code.  Item 4. in release 2.0.3 (below) proved remarkably
       prescient. 

  <li> A few minor improvements to the tag language have been made, most
       notably the &lt;insert&gt; sub-element of &lt;extract&gt;.

  <li> A bug in setting the content length header for proxied pages has been
       modified has been patched.  Using the PIA as a proxy with the toolbars
       turned on should no longer cause problems with pages getting truncated.

  <li> The unix batch files in PIA/bin (pia, process, pia_wrapper) have been
       modified to work properly with or without having a classpath setting.  
       (Without a classpath, it's best run with PIA/src/java as your current
       directory.)
       The Windows batch file PIA/bin/pia.bat (piajdk.bat no longer needed) 
       no longer touches classpath, but changes directory to PIA/src/java and runs
       from there.  (It may still be necessary to change the properties of
       your DOS box to enable more environment variables.)
</ol>

<h3>Release 2.0.3</h3>

<p> This is the second patch to Release 2.0; things are beginning to
    stabilize.

<p> Changes since 2.0.2:

<ol>
  <li> It is now possible to ``mount'' an Agent anywhere in the URL hierarchy.
  <li> An Agent's home, user, and data directories can be specified
       separately.  Directories can be specified relative to any of several
       different roots.
  <li> The output of the DPS is now almost totally XML-compliant.  The
       <code>process -n</code> command can be used to bring random files into
       compliance; this has been done with all <code>.xh</code> and
       <code>.ts</code>files in the PIA.
  <li> Most (we dare not hope for ``all'') of the broken links have been
       fixed. 
  <li> Obsolete test code has been removed from org/risource/dps/test,
       org/risource/test/dom, ds, and pia subdirectories. </li>
  <li> Pages have been added to the Demo agent to illustrate use of the
       debug and output handlers. </li>
  <li> Precompiled zip and jar files have been removed from $PIA_HOME/lib.  
       All classes are now accessed through the $PIA_HOME/src/java path.  
       Also, due to Makefile changes, it is no longer necessary to add 
       this path to your CLASSPATH. </li>
  <li> A list of known bugs has been added to www.risource.org.  It is accessed
       from the PIA page, known bugs link.</li>
  <li> The PIA namespace has been made available so that the PIA
       properties listed in the pia.props file are now accessible to agents.</li>
</ol>


<h3>Release 2.0.2</h3>

<p>
This is the first patch to the first external open source release of the PIA.
It is <em>still</em> intended primarily for developers.  Several directories
have been moved, and a few obsolete ones have been removed.  This trend can be
expected to continue for a while.  

<p> Major changes since 2.0.1A:

<ul>
  <li> The Java directory structure has been revised to conform to current
       naming conventions. What was once <code>src/java/crc</code> is now
       <code>src/java/org/risource</code>.  The RegEx package and the subset
       of the Jigsaw classes that we are actually using have been brought up
       to date and moved to their proper places in the package hierarchy.

  <li> CVS ID's had lost their all-important <code>$</code><code>Id:...$</code>
       due to an ill-advised ``export''.  They're back.

  <li> HTML document types now refer to the correct public identifier,<br>
       "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN".  It is possible (likely?) that
       some documents do not validate yet.  The document types in
       <code>.xh</code> files are passed through the document processor
       unmodified, so they refer to the DTD of the <em>output</em>, not of the
       input file.  This will change so that the document types are properly
       set by the processor (<code>.xh</code> files will have XML DTD's
       corresponding to the "tagsets" that they use.  Output files will have
       their document types set appropriately -- usually HTML.)  Also, we
       recommend that any <code>.xh</code> files you create adhere to the XML
       spec (quoted attribute values, include all end tags, etc.)  Even though
       our processor will accept a wider range of (SGML) document syntax,
       using well formed XML will make it easier for you to process your
       <code>.xh</code> files with other tools should you choose to do so.  We
       are in the process of converting all of our examples to strictly
       conform to the spec.

  <li> The Toolbar, History, and Cache agents, all of which operate by
       proxying through the PIA, have been gathered underneath the (new)
       ``Proxie'' agent.  The agent namespace still isn't right, but this is
       at least useable.  If you made yourself a custom START-UP.html file,
       make a new one.  Proxie is poorly-documented at the moment.  Your
       browsing history (in <a href="/~History">/~History</a>) will be
       unaffected by these and future changes. 

  <li> The obsolete directories <code>Agents/Logo</code> and
       <code>Doc/Graphics</code> have been removed.

  <li> Property names (stored in <code>Config/pia.props</code> now start with
       <code>pia.</code> instead of <code> crc.pia. </code>.

  <li> The interface <code>org.risource.Version</code> has been added to
       contain version-number constants.  Running <code>pia -version</code>
       prints out the version string.
</ul>



<h3>Release 2.0.1A</h3>
<p>

This is the first external open source release of the PIA.  It is
intended for developers working on the PIA internals.  This is NOT a stable
release -- the system does work, but many links are broken due to code changes
made in preparing for the external release.  Release 2.1 will be the first
stable release.   We suggest that persons who wish to use the PIA to develop
applications but are not interested in debugging/programming the core engine
wait for 2.1.  Subscribe to <a href="mailto:PIA-announce-request@risource.org">
PIA-announce@RiSource.org</a> to be notified of new releases.

<p>

<p>
We recommend starting by installing and running your own
copy of the PIA.  (See the <a href="../install.html">
Installation manual</a> for instructions.)
Once the agency is running, you can view further documentation and try
customizing the demonstration agents.

<h3><a name="newfeatures">New Features</a></h3>
<h4>Document Processing System</h4>

<p>The Document Processing System is a completely new rewrite of the PIA's
extension language for active HTML and XML documents.  The parser can handle
both HTML and XML, and the internal data structures are compliant with the <a
href="http://www.w3c.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a>'s
<a href="http://www.w3c.org/DOM/">Document Object Model</a> standard.

<p>Details can be found in the <a href="../API/internals.html">Internals
Manual</a>, and of 
course in the <a href="../../src/java/crc/dps">source code</a>.
<p>

<h4>New Tag Language</h4>

<p>The extension programming language used to write active documents
(Interforms) has been almost completely revised, and considerably simplified.
Details can be found in the  <a href="../tagsets.html"> Pia Tagsets
Manual.</a>. 

<dl>
  <dt> <b>Note:</b>
  <dd> As of this release, some of the new tags are still unimplemented.
       A list of unimplemented tags, along with some known bugs, and desirable
       enhancements can be found on the
       <a href="../../src/java/crc/dps/to-do.html">to-do list</a>.
</dl>
<p>

<p> You will notice that are classes/package names are prefixed with crc.
    This stands for California Research Center.  We are considering changing
    the prefix to org.risource. 


<h4>Miscellaneous items</h4>

<p>In preparing the code for external release, several obsolete packages were
removed.  Some of these packages are referenced in the test code and may lead
to error messages when doing a full make.  You can safely ignore these
messages.
<p>
Small pieces of a few external packages are used in places by the PIA software
(Jigsaw,Jcrypt, regexp).  
Thanks to Anselm, John Dumans, Shugo Maeda, and the others who have
contributed their software to the community.

<p> The current version of the DOM that we use is not the latest (we are
    hoping to upgrade soon.)  The interface classes provided by the W3C for
    the version we are using is  PIA/src/java/w3c.  The latest
    version (which is incompatible with our current implementation) is
    available from the <a href=http://www.w3c.org/> W3C</a>.
