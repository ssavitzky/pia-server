it describes:</p><ul><li><a href = "#Files">Agent files</a></li>
<li><a href = "#Naming">Agent naming</a></li>
<li><a href = "#Tips">Tips on agent creation</a></li></ul><p>The
extended HTML tags needed to create agents are described in the <a
    href = "Manuals/InterForm/Tagset/pia-xhtml.html">PIA XHTML Manual</a>.</p><p>Source code
for sample agents is in the <a href = "../Agents">Agents</a> directory
at the top-level of the PIA's installation tree. Feel free to use
these files as a source of ideas and examples, and as a basis for
creating new agents.</p><h2><a name = "Files"></a>Agent Files</h2><p>This
section describes the files that make up an agent and the search
path the PIA uses in locating those files.</p><h3>Standard Files</h3><p>A
PIA Agent consists of little more than a collection of extended
HTML (XHTML) files organized in a directory and automatically generated.
Agents require a set of standard files. Those files, listed below,
are "inherited" from the root directory if they are not found in
the agent's home directory.</p><ul><li><code>home.xh</code><br>The
agent's "home page." This is the page that appears when he agent
is selected from the Agency's list of running agents. It is therefore
the first page seen by a user. It includes an index of the agent's
other pages. It is returned from a request for <code>/AgentName</code>.</li>
<li><code>index.xh</code><br>The page returned from a request for <code>/AgentName/</code>.
Note the trailing slash that distinguishes this page from the home
page. It gives a standardized listing of the agent's top-level extended
HTML form. Typically, it needs no customization.</li>
<li><code>options.xh</code><br>Lists the agent's options. This page
seldom requires customization.</li>
<li><code>initialize.xh</code> <br>This XHTML file is invoked automatically
when the agent is installed. It defines default values for any options
and sets the "match criteria" for transactions that the agent acts
on. This file does <em>not</em> have a default, and can be omitted
if not needed.</li></ul><h3>Search Path</h3><p>The PIA follows a
search path in seeking the extended HTML files that comprise an
agent. Agents look first in directories under <var><code>USR_DIR</code></var>,
then in those under <var><code>PIA_DIR</code></var> and finally
in <code><var>PIA_DIR</var>/src</code> That path is as follows:</p><ol>
<li>The <code>AgentType/AgentName</code> directory.<ul><li><code>USR_DIR/Agents/AgentType/AgentName/</code><br>The
user's custom XHTML files for this agent.</li>
<li><code>PIA_DIR/Agents/AgentType/AgentName/</code><br>The Agent's
home directory.</li>
<li><code>PIA_DIR/src/Agents/AgentType/AgentName/</code><br>The
home directory for experimental agents and development tools. </li></ul></li>
<li>The <code>Agents/AgentName</code> directory<ul><li>The <code>AgentName</code> directory <code>USR_DIR/Agents/AgentName/</code> <br>The
user's custom XHTML forms for this agent.   </li>
<li> <code>PIA_DIR/Agents/AgentName/</code><br> The agent's home
directory</li>
<li> <code>PIA_DIR/src/Agents/AgentName/</code><br> The home directory
for experimental agents and development tools.</li></ul></li>
<li>The <code>Agents/AgentType</code> directory.<ul><li> <code>USR_DIR/Agents/AgentType/</code> <br>The
user's custom XHTML files for this agent type.</li>
<li> <code>PIA_DIR/Agents/AgentType/</code><br>The agent type's
home directory.   </li>
<li> <code>PIA_DIR/src/Agents/AgentType/</code>. </li></ul></li>
<li>The <code>Agents</code> directory<ul><li><code>USR_DIR/Agents/</code> <br>The
user's customized default XHTML files. </li>
<li> <code>PIA_DIR/Agents/</code> <br>The PIA's default XHTML files.</li></ul></li></ol><code><var>USR_DIR</var></code><p> is
normally <code>$HOME/.pia</code>, and is accessible as the DOFS
agent <code>/&Root;</code>. <code>PIA_DIR</code> is normally
either <code>$HOME/pia</code> (if the user has their own working
copy of the PIA source code), or wherever the PIA is installed;
it is accessible as the DOFS agent <code>/PIA</code>.</p><h2><a
    name = "Naming"></a>Agent Naming</h2><p>Every agent has a <em>name</em> and
a <em>type</em>. The type is used to create a family of agents with
similar behavior but different options. The <a href = "/DOFS">DOFS</a> agents
form such a family. So do the <a href = "/Toolbar">&Toolbar;</a> agents <a
    href = "/Toolbar/Remote">Remote</a> and <a
    href = "/Toolbar/Localfile">Localfile</a>. In most case, the
type classification name represents not only the family name but
names an agent of which the others are "sub-agents."</p><p>Agents
that are not "sub-agents" of some type have the name (<code>&#38;agentName;</code>)
and type (<code>&#38;agentType;</code>). An XHTML form can verify
this with the following test: </p><blockquote> <code>&#60;test exact
match="&#38;agentName;>"&#38;agentType;&#60;/test></code></blockquote><p>By
convention, agent names intended to be seen at the top level of
an agent listing are capitalized, but this is not required. Name
lookup is case-sensitive, and there may be good reasons to prefer
uppercase or lowercase names in some cases. For example, DOFS is
uppercase because it is an acronym. Most agents with DOFS as their
type have lowercase names except for the "standard" ones <code>/&Root;</code> and <code>/PIA</code>.
For another example, <code>Localfile</code> and <code>Remote</code> are
sub-agents of <code>&Toolbar;</code>, and so have lowercase names. </p><p>At
some point it will be possible to make sub-agents invisible at the
top level. </p><h3>Agent Data Structures and Code</h3><p>Every installed
agent has an associated software object which contains its options
(stored as entities in the <code>AGENT</code> namespace) and the
criteria that match features of the transactions in which the agent
has registered interest.</p><p>This object is normally an instance
of the class <code>GenericAgent</code>. If a subclass of this class
is defined in the package <code>crc.pia.agent</code>, and its name
matches the agent's type (with the first character capitalized,
the rest in lowercase, and all period (<code>.</code>) and hyphen
(<code>-</code>) characters converted to underscore (<code>_</code>)
characters), it is loaded automatically when the agent is installed.</p><p>It
is sometimes necessary to use a different programming language other
than Java for part of an agent. For example, PERL is good for text
manipulation). One choice is to put the external code into a CGI
script (with a <code>.cgi</code> extension); another is to use the
OS-command <code>actor</code>. PERL is a good choice for a scripting
language because it is nearly as ubiquitous as Java. Be warned, though,
that not all of its libraries or extensions are available on all
systems.</p><h2><a name = "Tips"></a>Tips on Agent Creation</h2><p>PIA
agents, and active documents are so new that few conventions have
become established for their use and there is considerable room
for experimentation. A few rules of thumb have become clear:</p><h3>Uniform
Look and Feel</h3><p>Use "include" files to give a family of related
agents a similar appearance. The PIA uses <code>header.inc</code> in
this way; almost every agent XHTML page includes the code which
expands into a standardized heading.: </p><blockquote><code>&#60;set
entity name=title><em>short title</em>&#60;/set></code><br> <code>read
interform file=heading.inc process</code></blockquote><p>The standard <code>include</code> files
currently available are: </p><ul><li> <code>heading.inc</code><br> The
standard header   </li>
<li> <code>about.inc</code>   <br> Information "about" an agent.
This information is similar to what you might see on the        "about"
menu item on a Windows or Macintosh application. This is displayed
by the default <code>home.xh</code> file just underneath the quick
reference described in the section that follows. </li>
<li> <code>insert.inc</code><br> An image or set of links "inserted"
in the normally-empty space to the left of the quick reference.
On an application, this is often a link to the agent that serves
as a control panel.</li></ul><p>You can also copy and extend the
default <code>home.xh</code> file to get a slight extension or modification
of one of the standard quick references.</p><h3>Quick Reference
Up Front</h3><p>An agent's home page is the easiest to access. Additionally,
many users have browsers with small screens. Therefore it makes
sense to put the most-commonly-used functions, and links to the most-commonly-used
pages, as close to the top of an agent's home page as possible.</p><p>There
are two common formats for this. The first uses a single column
of links near the right-hand side of the screen. The column just
to the left contains a small number of labels. </p><p>The second
format is used on the home pages of applications, which typically
have many functions. It consists of <em>three</em> columns of icons
or of mixed icons and text.</p><h3>No Nasty Surprises</h3><p>It
is perfectly possible to put a query string into a link, and so
have an ordinary-looking link or icon that is equivalent to submitting
a form. In a PIA this can have drastic effects (there is, for example,
an XHTML form you can use to <a href = "/Admin/shutdown.if">shut
down the PIA</a>).</p><p>Many users experiment, clicking links at
random. You may want to use a robot to build an index of your PIA,
or to identify broken links. It's a good idea to make any irreversible
actions the result of submitting a form, rather than just following
a link. This also gives you a chance to ask the user for confirmation.</p><blockquote>Eventually
it is possible to use standard HTTP authentication to keep unauthorized
users away from agents or forms you do not want them to use.</blockquote><h3>Active
Documentation</h3><p>XHTML forms make it easy to mix controls or
forms with their documentation. Thus, it is possible not only to <em>describe</em> a
function such as a link to a useful page or a form, but to provide
the thing itself and invite the reader to try it out on the spot.</p><p>Wherever
possible, an agent should be self-documenting, including links to
whatever documents a user may need. This includes tips on customization
as well as advice on how to set the options. A <code>HEADER.html</code> or <code>index.html</code> file
in the agent's home directory may be useful, since it can provide
documentation that the user sees while browsing the agent's source
code directory <em>before</em> installation. It should include an
installation form, especially if an agent has many options.</p><h3>Readable
Source</h3><p>It goes without saying that the output of a XHTML
file--the user's view--should be easily read, understood, and used.
But so should the input--the author's view. </p><p>Appropriate indentation
makes for easier to read code. Indent the content of elements such
as lists and control structures. Comment the file as appropriate.</p><p>Keep
a to-do list. Document your design decisions, including things you
tried that turned out to be mistakes. </p><p>Use source control
(the PIA group uses CVS, which is free, well-supported, and well-suited
for projects with multiple developers).</p><p>Remember, an agent's
XHTML files are read not only by their author, but by any users
who want to customize or extend them. If the agent is complicated,
consider writing an "implementation detail" document.</p><h4><a
    name = "Directory">Directory Structure</a></h4><p>Your Information
Agency makes use of two directories:</p><ul><li><var>PIA_DIR</var> contains
the code, documentation, agents and other files released by the
PIA group.</li>
<li><var>PIA_HOME</var> (typically <tt>~/.pia </tt>stores agent
data and customized <dfn>interforms</dfn>.</li></ul><p>By default,
agents read and write their data files into <var>PIA_HOME/AGENT_NAME</var> (where <var>AGENT_NAME</var> is
the name of the agent. For example, the <var>History</var> agent
keeps lists of visited URLs in <tt>~/.pia/History/</tt>) </p><p>In
seeking their interforms, agents look first in <code><var>PIA_HOME/Agents/AGENT_NAME</var></code>, where <var>AGENT_NAME</var> is
the name of the agent in question. If that search fails, the agent
then checks <var><code>PIA_DIR/Agents/AGENT_NAME</code></var>. Thus
the <var>History</var> agent searches for its files in <kbd>~/.pia/Agents/History </kbd>and
then in <kbd>/usr/local/bin/pia/Agents/History</kbd>.</p><p>This
makes it easy to customize your agents by simply putting new interform
files in <code><var>PIA_HOME/Agents/AGENT_NAME/FILENAME.xh</var></code>.
For example, a customized form, <tt>foo.xh</tt> for the <var>History</var> agent
would go in <tt>~/.pia/Agents/History/foo.xh</tt>.)</p><h4><a
    name = "Customizing">Customizing an Existing Agent</a></h4><p>This
section shows how to add a new function to the <var>History</var> agent.
The new feature allows you to see a display of all web pages visited
on the current day.</p><p>In the example that follows, assume that <var>PIA_HOME</var> has
the value <code>~/.pia</code>. </p><ol><li>Create a file, <tt>~/.pia/Agents/History/today.xh</tt>.</li>
<li>Add the following content:<br><tt>&#60;html>&#60;body></tt><br><tt>&#60;h2>
Web pages visited Today&#60;/h2></tt><br><tt>&#60;include src="&#38;year;/&#38;month;/&#38;day;.html"></tt><br><tt>&#60;/body>&#60;/html></tt></li>
<li>Save the file <code>today.xh</code>. </li>
<li>Use your browser to view the URL <code><a
    href = "/History/today.xh">/History/today.xh</a></code> If
you have been using your agency as a proxy to view external documents,
you should get a listing of all places you visited today.</li></ol><h5>What
Is Going On?</h5><p>To understand the workings of this interform,
it is necessary to understand both the <var>History</var> agent
and the specifics of this particular interform file.</p><p>The <var>History</var> agent
stores information on URLs visited in files organized by date. For
example, the file <tt>~/.pia/History/1997/07/11.html </tt> stores
all the URLs visited on July 11, 1997. The interform <var>today.xh</var> exploits
this fact.</p><p>The interform shown above contains the standard
HTML tags <code>&#60;html></code>, <code>&#60;body></code>, <code>&#60;h2></code> and
one non-standard tag <code>&#60;include></code>. The power of the
interform comes from this special tag.</p><p>The interform also
makes use of three entities, <var>&#38;year;</var>, <var>&#38;month;</var> and <var>&#38;day;</var>.
By assigning the value of the <var>file</var> attribute to these
entities, rather than a hard-coded date, the interform always makes
use of the current day's date.</p><p>Putting it all together, the
tag <tt>&#60;read file="&#38;year;/&#38;month;/&#38;day;.html"></tt> tells the <var>History</var> agent
to read the specified file and insert the contents at this location.
The entities are resolved and if there is a file for the current
day it is displayed. If not, the <code>&#60;read></code> tag results
in no new text being inserted.</p><p>The <a href = "basic.html">Basic
Tagset Manual</a> provides further details on each interform tag
and entity. </p><h3><a name = "Creating"></a>Creating a New Agent</h3><p>This
section describes how to build an agent from scratch. It describes
how to create an agent named <var>HelloWorld</var>. </p><ol><li>Begin
by creating a directory for the agent's interforms.<br>Create the
directory, <tt>~/.pia/Agents/HelloWorld</tt>. </li>
<li>Create a home page for your agent, <tt>~/.pia/Agents/HelloWorld/home.xh</tt> with the
following content:<pre>&#60;!doctype html public "-//IETF//DTD HTML//EN//2.0">
&#60;HTML> &#60;html> &#60;body> <br>&#60;header> Hello World&#60;/header><br>&#60;h2>

entered the greeting: <br>  &#60;p>&#60;font size=+5 color="FF0000"><br> 
  &#60;get name=FORM:data> &#60;/font> &#60;/p> <br>&#60;/then><br>&#60;else>
 <br>  &#60;form action="" method="post"> <br>  My mission is to
display a greeting.<br>  "Hello World!" is customary, but I am very
flexible.<br>  My owner, , may decide. &#60;p> 
   &#60;input type="submit" value="Enter"> <br>   A Greeting: &#60;input
name="data">  &#60;p> &#60;/form> <br>&#60;/else><br>&#60;/if><br>&#60;footer
/>&#60;/body>&#60;/html>  </pre></li>
<li>Install your agent using the <a href = "/Admin/install-agent.xh">/<code>Admin/install-agent.xh</code></a> interform. </li>
<li>Go to that page, enter <tt>HelloWorld</tt> as the name of your
agent and click on the install button.</li></ol><p>You should now

</table><p>The <var>HelloWorld</var> interform checks to see if
the user has submitted a form. If so, the form data is processed
and the results displayed. If no form has been submitted, the form
is presented for the user to fill out. </p><h3><a name = "Tips"></a>Tips
on Agent Creation</h3><p>The following section contains tips on
creating agents.  Additional ideas and
inspiration might come from a close look at the interforms of agents
that ship with the PIA.</p><h4><a name = "installing">Installing
Agents</a></h4><p>In order for the PIA Agency to know about a particular
agent and direct requests to that agent appropriately, that agent
must be installed. As agents are represented by persistent software objects,
agent installation creates the object that corresponds to the agent
in question.</p><p>On start-up, the Information Agency looks in
the directory <var>PIA_HOME</var> and then <var>PIA_DIR</var> for
the subdirectory <code>/Admin/Agency/START-UP.html.</code> This
file specifies those agents that should be installed. You should
copy and modify this file to start your own agents.</p><p>Each time
an agent is started, the PIA loads its <tt>initialize.xh</tt> interform,
if one exists. Consider creating such a file for your agent in <code>initialize.xh</code>.
This file typically contains default values for variables are used
by your agent.</p><h4>Interforms</h4><p>Entity variables can be
several levels deep. For example, <tt>&#38;AGENT:employees;</tt> might
return the first item in a list of employees associated with this
agent.</p><h4>Inheritance</h4><p>Standard forms such as  <code>options.xh</code>,
can be inherited from the Agents directory. The PIA Agent looks
in the <var>Agents</var> directory if this form is not found in
that agents subdirectory, <code>/Agents/<var>AGENT_NAME</var></code>.</p><h3>Processing
Documents Not Specifically Requested</h3><p>Agents can process documents
moving through the agency even if they are not specifically directed
to that agent. For example, the History and CIA agents process all
proxied documents. Each agent registers a criteria for the documents
it is interested in. Whenever the agency sees a document that matches
an agent's registered criteria, (requests for documents are considered
documents in their own right), that agent is given a chance to process
the document before sending it on to its destination.</p><h3><a
    name = "Debugging"></a>Debugging Tag-Based Agents</h3><p>As
with any code, agent code may not always work correctly the first
time. Here are some techniques for understanding what is happening
within your agent.</p><ul><li>Use the <tt>&#38;urlQuery</tt>; PIA
tag to check the name/value pairs that are being posted from one
page to another. For example: <code>fullname=Master+of+the+Universe&#38;wea=Weather&#38;submission=Submit</code> indicates
these entries: fullname, Weather checkbox and Submit button.</li>
<li>Look at the HTML source that is generated, using <var>View/Document
Source</var> in the browser menu. This gives a good indication of
where the code broke down.</li>
<li>Put in print statements and expand variables inside tagset elements
to check whether they have been set correctly.</li></ul><hr><b>Copyright
