<h2><a name="Environment">Operating Environment</a></h2>

<p> You need the following software to run the PIA:</p>

<ul>
<li> Java (A Java Runtime Environment, <code>JRE 1.1.3</code> or higher, is
     needed to use the software.  Programmers wishing to modify the code will
     need a Java Development Kit <code>JDK</code>.) Java for Solaris and
     Windows can be obtained from <code>
     <a href="http://www.javasoft.com">java.sun.com</a></code> (direct links
     to <a
     href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.2/jre/index.html">JRE</a> or
     <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/products/jdk/1.2/">JDK</a>).  Java for
     Linux can be obtained from
     <a href="http://www.blackdown.org/"><code>www.blackdown.org</code></a>

     <p>The PIA is known to run under Java 1.1.3 and and Java 1.2 on Solaris,
     Linux, and Windows.  It runs on Linux under Kaffe, but there are some
     problems with compilation. </p>
     </li>

<li> An operating system that supports sockets and long filenames.  We
     have run the PIA software on Linux (Red Hat 4.2 -6.0 with the <a
     href="http://www.blackdown.org/">blackdown.org</a> JDK), Windows 9X, and
     Solaris on SPARC.  It does not seem to work on the Macintosh
     because of differences in file handling.
     </li>
     
<li> Utilities for unpacking the files (<code>tar</code> and
     <code>gunzip</code> on unix, <code>winzip</code> on Windows).
     </li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="Running">Running the PIA </a></h2>


<p>On UNIX or Linux, once you have set up the <code><var>PIA_HOME</var></code>
and <code><var>PIA_ROOT</var></code> environment variables you can launch the
PIA with the command: ``<code>$PIA_HOME/bin/pia</code>'', or just
``<code>pia</code>'' if <code>$PIA_HOME/bin</code> is in your search path.  A
complete list of command-line options can be found by running
<kbd>$PIA_HOME/bin/pia -help</kbd> at the shell prompt.</p>

<p>Under Windows 9x and NT, launch the PIA in a DOS window with the command:
<code><var>PIA_HOME</var>/bin/pia.bat</code> -- this is a batch file that makes
use of the <code><var>PIA_HOME</var></code> and <code><var>PIA_ROOT</var></code>
environment variables, and is similar in function to <code>pia_wrapper</code>
on Unix.</p>

<p>The <code>process</code> command allows the PIA software to be
used as a unix filter for processing HTML and XML documents.  Under Windows 9x
and NT the CLASSPATH must be set to <code><var>PIA_HOME</var>/src/java</code>
in order for <code>process</code> to run.


<p> <strong>=== this section needs lots more work ===</strong>

<p>The
<code>-port</code> option can be used to set the port (default is 8888, a
non-privileged port that allows normal user logins to run the PIA on Unix
boxes.  You can also set it to most other port numbers (8080, 8001, etc.) in
the <code>PIA/_subsite.xcf</code> file, as shown in
<code>Config/Site/sample.xcf</code>. But note that such ports may not be
accessible by machines everywhere (a browser behind a firewall may not be
allowed to access these ports)... so if you want to ensure your PIA server is
completely accessible to the public, try the port-80 trick below.</p>

<p>If you want to use the administrator-priveleged port 80 (accessed by the
simpler URL <code> http://HOST/ </code> instead of <code>
http://HOST:8888/</code>), you must either have administrator priveleges when
running the PIA, or you must run a web server, such as Apache, on port 80 as a
proxy to the PIA on a different port, and set the PIA's "virtualport"
variable to 80 so that pages served by the PIA appear to
come from port 80 rather than from the port the PIA listens to.

<p>The <code>process</code> command allows the PIA software to be
used as a unix filter for processing HTML and XML documents.  Under Windows 9x
and NT the CLASSPATH must be set to <code><var>PIA_HOME</var>/src/java</code>
in order for <code>process</code> to run.

<h2><a name="Using">Using the PIA</a></h2>

<p> The PIA acts as a Web server.  Assuming you have gotten the PIA to run in
    its default configuration, you should now be able to browse to <code><a
    href="http://localhost:8888/">http://localhost:8888/</a></code> in order
    to access the PIA's own web pages.  If the default configuration is
    different and you have run the PIA from a command line, it will have
    printed out a line like:
</p>

<pre>
  Point your browser to &lt;URL: http://blackroot.crc.ricoh.com:8001&gt;
</pre>

<p> after initializing, and you can cut-and-paste the URL on that line into
    your browser and go from there. 
</p>

<p> There are some applications--such as a browser proxy and browsing-history
    system--which require that your browser use the PIA as a proxy.  This
    enables the PIA to process any incoming and outgoing pages as you would
    like.  See the <code>Proxie</code> for more details.
</p>


<h2><a href="Processing">Processing Documents</a></h2>

<p> If you want to use the pia as a XML-to-XML processor---reading and writing
    XML files using active tags, no web ports involved---you can use the
    command <code>process [filename]</code>, which sends the converted XML
    directly to the console (standard output).
</p>


<p> <strong>=== this section needs lots more work ===</strong>


<h2><a name="Configuring">Configuring the PIA</a></h2>

<p>When the PIA starts, it looks for either a configuration file or a ``root''
directory (which should <em>contain</em> a configuration file).  The PIA will
look for its top-level configuration file in the following places:</p>

<ol>
  <li> A file or directory specified on the command line.
  <li> The environment variable <var>PIA_ROOT</var>
  <li> A system-specific default root directory (see above)
  <li> The PIA's ``home directory,'' <var>PIA_HOME</var>
</ol>

<p>The default configuration file name is <var>_subsite.xcf</var>; this can be
changed with the <code>-config</code> command-line option or in the top-level
configuration file.  Any directory may contain a configuration file with the
specified name, except that the configuration file in the root is ignored if a
separate top-level configuration file is specified. </p>

<p>Once a configuration file is found, all of the PIA's configuration
information is loaded from it -- where to look for active pages, which ones to
start up immeditely in the background (such as broswer-proxies), what ports,
filename-extension mappings, and tagsets to use, and so forth... even the path
of the root directory can appear there.  Several sample configuration files can
be found in the directory <a
href="../Config/Site/"><code>$PIA_HOME/Config/Site/</code></a>.  </p> 


<p> If you change any configuration options (such as editing a
    <code>_subsite.xcf</code> file or renaming a tagset file), you should
    re-start the PIA to ensure the server knows about those changes.  The
    results may be very confusing otherwise.</p>


<h2><a name="Updating">Updating the PIA</a></h2>

<p> The PIA is maintained using the CVS version control system, and a public
    CVS repository is available on RiSource.org.  See <code><a
    href="http://www.RiSource.org/PIA/cvs.shtml"
    >www.risource.org/PIA/cvs.shtml</a></code> for more information, including
    how to log in to the anonymous CVS server.
</p>

<p> CVS version control information is included in the <code>tar</code> file
    you used for installation; once you have logged in (which you only need to
    do once) all you have to do in order to update your copy of the PIA to the
    latest version is:

<pre>
  cd $PIA_HOME
  cvs update -d -P
</pre>

<p> The CVS repository is updated more frequently than the <code>tar</code>
    archive -- essentially whenever a developer feels that the portion of the
    PIA they have been working on is stable enough for others to try.
</p>


<h2><a name="Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h2>

<p> Here are some frequently encountered problems:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<p> <strong>The PIA doesn't seem to pay attention to changes in a file, or
    doesn't read or write a file where expected.</strong>  This usually
    occurs because there are two parallel directory trees: <code>PIA/</code>
    and <code>.pia/</code> (or more formally, <code>$PIA_HOME/</code> and
    <code>$PIA_ROOT/</code>), and <code>.pia/</code> takes precedence.  So
    changes made in the <code>PIA/</code> tree may (or may not) be used,
    depending upon whether there is a corresponding file in the
    <code>.pia/</code> tree: the server always reads files in
    <code>.pia/</code> first if it can, and always writes them there. </p>
    </li>

<li><p>
     <strong> The PIA doesn't seem to pay attention to newly-written tags,
	       extensions, or configuration options.</strong> This usually
	       occurs for one of two reasons.
     <ol> <li>The PIA was not restarted after a change (and thus did not know
	       about recent configuration changes).  The solution is to
	       restart the PIA after every configuration change, i.e. after
	       changing anything but the contents of <code>.xh</code> or
	       <code>.ts</code> file.</li>
	  <li> The PIA was not instructed to use the appropriate tagset or
	       extension.  While tags defined inside an active page are
	       automatically used, separate ".ts" tagset files are only used
	       when the <code>_subsite.xcf</code> file explicitly says
	       so.  So make sure that the file-extension type and desired
	       tagsets are explicitly mentioned (look at <code>Agents/</code>,
	       <code>Samples/</code>, and <code>Config/Site/</code> for
	       working examples.) </li>
      </ol>
     </p></li>

        <li>
<p> <strong>When testing for equality, the PIA thinks two things (strings,
    numbers, entities) are different when they should be the same.</strong>
    The PIA keeps track of <i>everything</i> in an object or entity, including
    carriage returns and leading/trailing spaces.  Unfortunately, when you
    follow proper indentation rules, all that invisible stuff becomes part of
    your object and changes it in subtle ways.  Here's an example of the
    problem and one way to fix it (you can find other such example solutions
    in our applications, such as SimpleCalendar):</p>
	     
	     <code><pre>
    Bad:     &lt;set name="hometown">
	         SiliconValley
	     &lt;/set>
             </pre></code>

    <p> In this case, the entity <code>hometown</code> contains leading and
	trailing carriage returns and spaces, which will register as separate
	text elements in a list and may disrupt tests like <nobr><code>&lt;test
	match="SiliconValley">&amp;hometown;&lt;/test></code></nobr>.  Here's the
	fix, which involves explicity trimming off that invisible stuff: </p>

	     <code><pre>	     
    Good:    &lt;set name="hometown">&lt;text trim="yes">
	         SiliconValley
	     &lt;/text>&lt;/set>
             </pre></code>

	     
    </li>


	<li>
<p> <strong> Lots of blank lines appear in the browser's "Page Source" window,
    and/or lists which should be empty do not test as empty, even after
    trimming.</strong> You may be using standard HTML-style comments
    <nobr><code>&lt;!-- like this --&gt;</code></nobr>, which the processor
    keeps track of (along with all the spaces and carriage returns between
    them!).  We suggest you instead use our special style of comments
    <nobr><code>&lt;?-- like this --?&gt;</code></nobr>, which are stripped
    away before any processing is done.

	     </p> </li>

</ul>
