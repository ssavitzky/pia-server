<h1>Introducing the Platform for Information Applications</h1>
</center>

<p>This document introduces the Platform for Information
Applications (PIA).The PIA defines a new generation of
document-oriented infoware with its reliance on XML to specify
processing. Information designers (authors, webmasters,
programmers, and others) use the PIA framework to build complete,
information intensive applications, called <i><a href= 
"http://www.sunworld.com/swol-01-1999/swol-01-regex.html#2">
infoware</a></i> that can be used via any web browser.</p>

<p>For the information developer, the PIA provides a core software
base on which they can build these kinds of applications without
having to learn a programming language. Developers benefit because
they can much more easily create, deliver, and maintain infoware
applications.</p>

<p>For the infoware user, the PIA just looks like a regular web
server that provides them access to the information application --
the collection of active pages that form a web site. Infoware
provides users with the information and functions they require in
the convenient and familiar form of web pages. The PIA further
benefits users by extending the open standard of the web to include
not only content and layout, but also the processing associated
with documents. This standard reduces costs and complexity of
managing their documents, and ensures that multiple infoware
applications in an office will work together.</p>

<p>The PIA design divides an application into a core processing
engine, the softare base that we call an <strong>agency</strong>,
and task specific collections of active XML web pages that we call
<strong>agents</strong>. The agents contain all the knowledge
required for a particular document processing task, and they are
supported by the agency.</p>

The slides accompanying the open source announcement of the PIA
give the best overview of the benefits of this technology and the
goals of the PIA project. This <a href= 
"http://www.risource.org/PIA/LinuxWorld1999/lw99.slides.html">
presentation</a> was given at the LinuxWorld Conference &amp; Expo,
March 4, 1999. 

<p>The full potential of the PIA will be realized as users and
developers build useful, task oriented agents. The PIA provides a
solid foundation that enables rapid development and customization
of agents. The PIA group has provided a number of example agents to
demonstrate some possibilities. See the <a href="agents.html">Agent
Guide</a> for a description of those agents that are currently
available.</p>

<h2><a name="Agency">Working with PIA Agency</a></h2>

<p>The <dfn>PIA Agency</dfn> is a program that manages a collection
of <dfn>agents</dfn>. Those agents operate on and communicate by
means of messages called <em>transactions</em>. Transactions are of
two types: <em>requests</em> and <em>responses</em>. A response is
generated by an agent or external server in reply to some
request</p>

<p>An agency can operate on behalf of an individual user, a group
of users, or a peripheral device. Thus an agency can operate
as:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <em>web server</em> handing back documents in response to
requests from a client such as a browser</li>

<li>a <em>client</em> requesting documents from other servers</li>

<li>a <em>proxy</em> passing requests and responses along to the
appropriate servers and clients, and possibly operating on the
documents in the process</li>
</ul>

<p>This versatility opens the door to many possible
applications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Agents can provide standard Web processing applications, like
workgroup applications that manage the processing of purchase
approval, expense reports, and other forms.</li>

<li>Agents can provide process information that comes from other
sources. For example, an agent could make it fast and easy for you
to simultaneously download many sound files from a server. The
agent first retrieves a page from the web server and processes that
page to include a check box next to every link. The user checks off
the files they want to download and when they submit the form the
agent automatically retrieves the specified files without requiring
any further action by the user.</li>

<li>An agent can also operate as a <em>personal</em> proxy, which
can keep track of all the documents you view on the web even if you
use different machines to access those documents (e.g., desktop and
laptop systems).</li>
</ul>

<p>Outside the agency, requests and responses are transmitted using
HTTP, a standard, widely used Internet protocol which is
operating-system and programming-language independent.</p>

<p>An agency provides a means of examining, modifying and
re-routing transactions among the various clients and servers. At
times it operates as a client, as a server, as a cache, and as a
proxy server depending upon the task it undertakes. As such, it
provides a new platform for document-oriented computing.</p>

<h3 id="CEGCDJID"><a name="How">How Agencies Work</a></h3>

<em>This section is optional reading for those who just want to use
the agency.</em> 

<p>Each transaction processed by an agency has a set of named <dfn>
features</dfn> with corresponding values (mostly boolean) which are
computed as needed. Each agent has a set of <dfn>criteria</dfn>
that are matched against a transaction's features. Agents that
match a transaction's criteria are allowed to <em>act on it</em>,
that is perform whatever operation the agent is designed to do.</p>

<p>A transaction also has a queue of objects (mainly agents and
transactions) called "satisfiers." After every agent has operated
on a transaction, the agency attempts to <em>satisfy</em> the
transaction by invoking the <code>handle</code> method of each
object in the queue. If none of the methods return <code>
true</code>, the agency performs a default action, generating an
error transaction for an unsatisfied request or forwarding a
response to its destination.</p>

<p>With the exception of a small number of built-in agents,
everything that an agent does is accomplished by <em>running</em>
an active document (for example, <code>home.xh</code>). Set-up is
done by means of a document called <code>initialize.xh</code>.
Further information on these files can be found in the document
<em><a href="author.html">Author's Guide</a></em>.</p>

<h2><a name="Agents">Working with Agents</a></h2>

<p>The PIA agency acts as a platform for computing using a
collection of "agents." An agent's files are organized as a
"sub-directory" of the agency's URL with each agent simply a
collection of documents. These documents can include standard HTML
tagging or make use of an extended set of tags which allows them to
function as <var>active</var> documents.</p>

<p>This section provides a basic introduction to the use of these
agents. For a more advanced example, see the <a href="/Agents/Swifty">
Swifty</a> application. Additional ideas and inspiration might come from
a close look at the files, known as interforms, that make up the
agents that ship with the PIA.</p>

<li><a href="#viewing">Viewing an Agent's Home Page</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Agents">Agents and Interforms</a></h3>

<p>That portion of the PIA that processes web documents is deemed
an Information Agency because each document request passed through
the agency is processed by one or more <dfn>agents</dfn>. Agents
are persistent software objects running on the Information Agency.
They perform one or more tasks on behalf of the agency's owner
while maintaining state and context information.</p>

<p>State maintenance along with the agency framework allows agents
to be more flexible, and much easier to generate and maintain than
traditional web processes such as CGI scripts.</p>

<p>The basis for each Information Agency is a set of XML documents
that can include one or more:</p>

<ul>
<li>Standard HTML tags</li>

<li>Predefined PIA tags</li>

<li>User defined tags created using the interform language</li>
</ul>

<p>When an agent receives a request for a document, it looks for
the file that matches that request. Once the file is found, it is
interpreted and the result returned.</p>

<p>For the end user, these files provide a <i>form-based</i>
interface for interacting with the agent, hence they are called
interforms. By convention, interform files are given the <tt>
.xh</tt> filename extension, reflecting the fact that they contain
an e<em>x</em>tended set of <em>H</em>TML tags.</p>

<p>The simplest agents might consist of one or more pages where
each page is defined using a combination of HTML, XML and extended
XML tags. There are also a number of predefined PIA tags available
for use. See the <em><a class="Tagsets/basic.html" href= 
"Tagsets/basic.html">Basic Tagset Manual</a></em> for more on these
tags.</p>

<h3><a name="Running"></a>Running an Information Agency</h3>

<p>To run an Information Agency, the PIA must be <a href= 
"install.html">installed</a> at your site. If you install your own
agency you can choose a custom set of agents as opposed to the
default set.</p>

<p>Once it is installed, you can start the PIA by executing the command
<tt><em>PIA_HOME</em>/bin/pia</tt>, where <tt><em>PIA_HOME</em></tt> is the
PIA's ``home directory'' -- the directory it was installed in.  If the PIA was
installed normally, this directory will be called PIA.  If you installed it in
your home directory, for example, the command to run the PIA would be:</p>

<pre>
  ~/PIA/bin/pia
</pre>

<p>While the PIA is starting up, you will see a sequence of messages something
like this:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;jaguar:717&gt; ~/PIA/bin/pia
CLASSPATH is not set and the current directory is not the 
Java source directory (/home/steve/PIA/bin/../src/java).
We will try to set an appropriate CLASSPATH, but you may experience problems
 -- if so try running from /home/steve/PIA/bin/../src/java or setting your 
CLASSPATH environment variable to include the necessary java classes.

Loading complete.
Point your browser to &lt;URL: http://jaguar.crc.ricoh.com:8888&gt;
</pre>

<p>At this point you can browse to the URL specified on the last line. </p>


<h4><a name="viewing"></a>Viewing an Agent's Home Page</h4>

<p>As soon as an agency is running, you can view that agency's home
page at <tt><a href="http://localhost:8888/">
http://<i>YOUR.HOST.NAME.HERE</i>:8888/</a></tt>using any
browser.</p>

<p>Notice the URL for this page. If your machine name is jaguar,
you might see the following:</p>

<code>http://jaguar:8888/Admin/ROOT/index</code>
<p>Note that the URL for the agency home page has three parts:
<br>
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>http://jaguar:8888</code> represents the machine name and
port number (your Information Agency).</li>

<li><code>Admin</code> represents the name of the agent handling
this request.</li>

<li><code>ROOT/index</code> represents the path from that agent's
root directory to the interform being displayed.</li>
</ul>

<p>This URL constitutes a request to the <tt>Admin</tt> agent
running on your local Information Agency. The <tt>Admin</tt> agent
is the agent responsible for installing, removing, and listing
other agents. It also manages miscellaneous tasks such as <a href= 
"http://www.RiSource.org/PIA/">reporting bugs</a>.</p>

<p>On your agency's home page, you should see a listing of all the
agents currently running on your Information Agency. Click on one
of the agent links to see the home page for that agent. By default,
your agency is configured to start up with the following
agents:</p>

<ul>
<li><var><a href="/Admin/home.xh">Admin</a></var> is the main agent
that manages all other agents</li>

<li><var><var><a name="agent.html#History" href="/History/home.xh">
History</a></var></var> maintains list of visited web pages</li>

<li>The Toolbar agencies

<ul>
<li><var><a href="/fileTools/">fileTools</a></var> adds a control
menu to pages served by your Information Agency</li>

<li><var><a class="agent.html#fbi" href="/remoteTools/">
remoteTools</a></var> adds a control menu to pages proxied through your
agency</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>

<p>These agents are further described in the <em><a href= 
"agents.html">Agent Guide</a></em>.</p>

<h4>Installing, Removing or Running Agents</h4>

<p>The PIA home page provides interforms that can be used to
perform basic management of agents including listing, adding and
removing agents.</p>

<p>The agent list presents links to an index of all of the
interforms for agents of a given type and to those agent's home
pages.</p>

<p>For more information on agent installation, see the <em><a href= 
"author.html#installing">Author's Guide</a></em>.</p>

<h2><a name="invoke">Program Invocation</a></h2>

<p>The PIA Document Processor can be invoked stand-alone as a CGI
or filter (formatter) or as part of the PIA. The command for
invoking the document processor as a filter is:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
process <em>[option]...</em> <em>input_filename</em>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The command-line options are:</p>

<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-e</code></dt>

<dd>Do not define standard entities.</dd>

<dt><code>-h</code></dt>

<dd>Print a help string.</dd>

<dt><code>-o <em>filename</em></code></dt>

<dd>Specify output file.</dd>

<dt><code>-p</code></dt>

<dd>Build a parse tree (which is output as a serialized Java
object)</dd>

<dt><code>-t <em>tagset-name</em></code></dt>

<dd>Specify tagset (default <code>xhtml</code>).</dd>

<dt><code>-s</code></dt>

<dd>Silent. Non-fatal error messages are suppressed.</dd>

<dt><code>-q</code></dt>

<dd>Quiet. Warnings and informational messages are suppressed.</dd>

<dt><code>-v</code></dt>

<dd>Verbose. Additional informational messages are output.</dd>

<dt><code>-d</code></dt>

<dd>Debugging. Information is output which may be of use for
debugging the interpreter.</dd>
</dl>

<p>For example, a possible start up command is:</p>

<blockquote><code>process -t xxml home.xh</code></blockquote>
