<body><center><h1>Introducing the Platform for Information Applications</h1></center><p>This
document introduces the Platform for Information Applications (PIA).The
PIA defines a new generation of document-oriented infoware with
its reliance on XML to specify processing. The PIA framework divides
an application into a core processing engine (called an agency)
and task specific modules (called agents) which consist primarily
of simple XML web pages.</p><p>The PIA functions as a web server
that makes requests, processes documents, and handles inquiries
on behalf of its "owner." This owner can be an individual making
use of a web browser or it can be a network device.</p><p>An individual
user might view the PIA as an agency employing electronic assistants,
known as <em>agents</em>. These agents work on behalf of the user
who <em>owns</em> the agency.</p><p>To use these agents, users must
configure their web browser's proxy setting to point to their PIA agency.
Once this is done, all requests for web documents are forwarded
through the agency allowing agents to monitor the user's activities
and retain useful information. (For example, the <var><a
    href = "/History/home.xh">History</a></var> agent maintains
a searchable list of all documents ever visited by its owner.) </p><p>When
the PIA acts on behalf of a device, such as a printer, it provides
access to the functions of that device from any web browser. Agents
can provide new features such as the ability to download, format,
and print web pages directly. By presenting a web-based, easy-to-use
interface, the agent can turn complicated, difficult to use computer
peripherals into easy to use <dfn><dfn>Information Applications</dfn></dfn>.</p><p>The
full potential of the PIA will be realized as users and developers
build useful, task oriented agents. The PIA provides a solid foundation
that enables rapid development and customization of agents. The
PIA group has provided a number of example agents to demonstrate
some possibilities. See the <a href = "agents.html">Agent Guide</a> for
a description of those agents that are currently available.</p><p>Topics
covered in this document include:</p><ul><li><a href = "#Agency">Working
with the PIA Agency</a></li>
<li><a href = "#Agents">Working with Agents</a></li></ul><hr><h2><a
    name = "Agency">Working with PIA Agency</a></h2><p>The <dfn>PIA
Agency</dfn> is a program that manages a collection of software <dfn>agents</dfn>.
Those agents operate on and communicate by means of messages called <em>transactions</em>.
Transactions are of two types: <em>requests</em> and <em>responses</em>.
A response is generated by an agent or external server in reply to
some request, while a request is "unsolicited."</p><p>An agency
can operate on behalf of an individual user, a group of users, or
a peripheral device. Thus an agency can operate as:</p><ul><li>a <em>web
server</em> handing back documents in response to requests from
a client such as a browser</li>
<li>a <em>client</em> requesting documents from other servers</li>
<li>a <em>proxy</em> passing requests and responses along to the
appropriate servers and clients, and possibly operating on the documents
in the process</li></ul><p>This versatility opens the door to many
possible applications:</p><ul><li>Agents can "web-enable" a standard
peripheral, such as a printer. Our web-printer can operate as a
proxy, serving page previews in response to requests.</li>
<li>Agents can provide the basis for a document-processing "thin
server." The web cache is an example of a thin server. </li>
<li>An agents can operate as your <em>personal</em> proxy, keeping
track of your browsing history, performing filtering operations,
and annotating documents. In addition, it can be a personal web server,
making selected directories on your desktop machine available to
others.</li></ul><p>Outside the agency, requests and responses are
transmitted using HTTP, a standard, widely used Internet protocol
which is operating-system and programming-language independent. </p><p>An
agency provides a means of examining, modifying and re-routing transactions
among the various clients and servers. At times it operates as a
client, as a server, as a cache, and as a proxy server depending
upon the task it undertakes. As such, it provides a new platform
for document-oriented computing.</p><h3 id = "CEGCDJID"><a name = "How">How
Agencies Work</a></h3><p>Each transaction processed by an agency
has a set of named <dfn>features</dfn> with corresponding values (mostly
boolean) which are computed as needed. Each agent has a set of <dfn>criteria</dfn> that
are matched against a transaction's features. Agents that match
a transaction's criteria are allowed to <em>act on it</em>, that
is perform whatever operation the agent is designed to do.</p><p>A
transaction also has a queue of objects (mainly agents and transactions)
called "satisfiers." After every agent has operated on a transaction,
the agency attempts to <em>satisfy</em> the transaction by invoking
the <code>handle</code> method of each object in the queue. If none
of the methods return <code>true</code>, the agency performs a default
action, generating an error transaction for an unsatisfied request
or forwarding a response to its destination.</p><p>With the exception
of a small number of built-in agents, everything that an agent does
is accomplished by <em>running</em> an active document (for example, <code>home.xh</code>).
Set-up is done by means of a document called <code>initialize.xh</code>.
Further information on these files can be found in the document <em><a
    href = "agents.html">Authoring Agents</a></em>. </p><h2><a
    name = "Agents">Working with Agents</a> </h2><p>The PIA agency
acts as a platform for computing using a collection of "agents."
An agent's files are organized as a "sub-directory" of the agency's
URL with each agent simply a collection of documents. These documents
can include standard HTML tagging or make use of an extended set of
tags which allows them to function as <var>active</var> documents.</p><p>This
section provides a basic introduction to the use of these agents.
For a more advanced example, see the <a href = "/Swifty">Swifty
Agent</a>. Additional ideas and inspiration might come from a close
look at the files, known as interforms, that make up the agents
that ship with the PIA.</p><p>Topics covered in this section include:</p><ul>
<li><a href = "#Agents">Agents and Interforms</a></li>
<li><a href = "#Running">Running an Information Agency</a></li>
<li><a href = "#viewing">Viewing an Agent's Home Page</a></li></ul><h3><a
    name = "Agents">Agents and Interforms</a></h3><p>That portion
of the PIA that processes web documents is deemed an Information
Agency because each document request passed through the agency is
processed by one or more <dfn>agents</dfn>. Agents are persistent
software objects running on the Information Agency. They perform
one or more tasks on behalf of the agency's owner while maintaining
state and context information.</p><p>State maintenance along with
the agency framework allows agents to be more flexible, and much easier
to generate and maintain than traditional web processes such as
CGI scripts.</p><p>The basis for each Information Agency is a set
of XML documents that can include one or more:</p><ul><li>Standard
HTML tags</li>
<li>Predefined PIA tags</li>
<li>User defined tags created using the interform language</li></ul><p>When
an agent receives a request for a document, it looks for the file
that matches that request. Once the file is found, it is interpreted
and the result returned.</p><p>For the end user, these files provide
a <i>form-based</i> interface for interacting with the agent, hence they
are called interforms. By convention, interform files are given
the <tt>.xh</tt> filename extension, reflecting the fact that they
contain an e<em>x</em>tended set of <em>H</em>TML tags.</p><p>The
simplest agents might consist of one or more pages where each page
is defined using a combination of HTML, XML and extended XML tags.
There are also a number of predefined PIA tags available for use.
See the <em><a class = "basic.html" href = "basic.html">Basic Tagset
Manual</a></em> for more on these tags.</p><h3><a name = "Running"></a>Running
an Information Agency</h3><p>To run an Information Agency, the PIA
must be <a href = "install.html">installed</a> at your site. If
you install your own agency you can choose a custom set of agents
as opposed to the default set.</p><p>Once it is installed, you can
start the PIA by executing the command <tt>PIA_DIR/bin/pia</tt>, where <tt>PIA_DIR</tt> is
the PIA home directory.</p><h4><a name = "viewing"></a>Viewing an
Agent's Home Page</h4><p>As soon as an agency is running, you can
view that agency's home page at <tt><a href = "http://localhost:8888/">http://<i>YOUR.HOST.NAME.HERE</i>:8888/</a></tt>using
any browser. </p><p>Notice the URL for this page. If your machine
name is jaguar, you might see the following:</p><code>http://jaguar:8888/Admin/ROOT/index</code><p>Note
that the URL for the agency home page has three parts:<br></p><ul><li><code>http://jaguar:8888</code> represents
the machine name and port number (your Information Agency).</li>
<li><code>Admin</code> represents the name of the agent handling
this request.</li>
<li><code>ROOT/index</code> represents the path from that agent's
root directory to the interform being displayed.</li></ul><p>This
URL constitutes a request to the <tt>Admin</tt> agent running on
your local Information Agency. The <tt>Admin</tt> agent is the agent
responsible for installing, removing, and listing other agents.
It also manages miscellaneous tasks such as <a href = "http://www.RiSource.org/PIA/">reporting
bugs</a>.</p><p>On your agency's home page, you should see a listing
of all the agents currently running on your Information Agency.
Click on one of the agent links to see the home page for that agent.
By default, your agency is configured to start up with the following
agents:</p><ul><li><var><a href = "/Admin/home.xh">Admin</a></var> is
the main agent that manages all other agents</li>
<li><var><var><a name = "agent.html#History" href = "/History/home.xh">History</a></var></var> maintains
list of visited web pages</li>
<li>The Toolbar agencies<ul><li><var><a
    href = "/Toolbar/Localfile/home.xh">Localfile</a></var> adds
a control menu to pages served by your Information Agency</li>
<li><var><a class = "agent.html#fbi" href = "/Toolbar/Remote/home.xh">Remote</a></var> adds
a control menu to pages proxied through your agency</li></ul></li>
<li><var><a href = "/PIA.home.xh">PIA</a></var> serves files located
in the <code>PIA_DIR</code> directory</li>
<li><var><a href = "/ROOT/home.xh">ROOT</a></var> serves files located
in your local <code>PIA_HOME</code> directory (usually identified
by<tt>~</tt> )</li></ul><p>These agents are further described in
the <em><a href = "agents.html">Agent Guide</a></em>.</p><h4>Installing,
Removing or Running Agents</h4><p>The PIA home page provides interforms
that can be used to perform basic management of agents including
listing, adding and removing agents. </p><p>The agent list presents
links to an index of all of the interforms for agents of a given
type and to those agent's home pages.</p><p>For more information
on agent installation see, <em><a href = "author.html#installing">Authoring
Agents</a></em>.</p><h2><a name = "invoke">Program Invocation</a></h2><p>The
PIA Document Processor can be invoked stand-alone as a CGI or filter
(formatter) or as part of the PIA. The command for invoking the
document processor as a filter is:</p><blockquote><pre>process <em>[option]...</em> <em>input_filename</em></pre></blockquote><p>The
command-line options are:</p><dl compact = "compact"><dt> <code>-e</code> 
 </dt>
<dd>Do not define standard entities.   </dd>
<dt> <code>-h</code>   </dt>
<dd>Print a help string. </dd>
<dt> <code>-o <em>filename</em></code>   </dt>
<dd>Specify output file. </dd>
<dt> <code>-p</code>   </dt>
<dd>Build a parse tree (which is output as a serialized Java object)
  </dd>
<dt> <code>-t <em>tagset-name</em></code>   </dt>
<dd>Specify tagset (default <code>xhtml</code>). </dd>
<dt> <code>-s</code>   </dt>
<dd>Silent.  Non-fatal error messages are suppressed. </dd>
<dt> <code>-q</code>   </dt>
<dd>Quiet.  Warnings and informational messages are suppressed.
  </dd>
<dt> <code>-v</code>   </dt>
<dd>Verbose.  Additional informational messages are output.   </dd>
<dt> <code>-d</code>   </dt>
<dd> Debugging.  Information is output which may be of use for debugging
the interpreter. </dd></dl><p>For example, a possible start up command
is:</p><blockquote><code>process -t xxml home.xh</code></blockquote><p>The
CGI version of the interform interpreter is: <code>interform.cgi</code> .
Information is passed to the interpreter according to the <a
    href = "http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/cgi/">Common Gateway Interface</a> specification.
The <code>.cgi</code> extension allows some servers (when suitably
configured) to recognize it as a CGI script even if placed in a user's
document directory.</p><hr><b>Copyright © 1999 Ricoh Silicon Valley</b></body></html>
