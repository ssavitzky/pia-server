<h1>Introducing the Platform for Information Applications</h1>
</center>

<p>This document introduces the Platform for Information
Applications (PIA).The PIA defines a new generation of
document-oriented infoware with its reliance on XML to specify
processing. Information designers (authors, webmasters,
programmers, and others) use the PIA framework to build complete,
information intensive applications, called <i><a href= 
"http://www.sunworld.com/swol-01-1999/swol-01-regex.html#2">
infoware</a></i> that can be used via any web browser.</p>

<p>For the information developer, the PIA provides a core software
base on which they can build these kinds of applications without
having to learn a programming language. Developers benefit because
they can much more easily create, deliver, and maintain infoware
applications.</p>

<p>For the infoware user, the PIA just looks like a regular web server that
provides them access to information applications -- the collections of active
pages that form a web site (or several sub-sites). Infoware provides users
with the information and functions they require in the convenient and familiar
form of web pages. The PIA further benefits users by extending the open
standard of the web to include not only content and layout, but also the
processing associated with documents. This standard reduces costs and
complexity of managing their documents, and ensures that multiple infoware
applications in an office will work together.</p>

<p>The PIA design divides an application into a core processing
engine, the softare base that we call an <strong>agency</strong>,
and task specific collections of active XML web pages that we call
<strong>applications</strong>. The applications contain all the knowledge
required for a particular document processing task, and they are
supported by the agency.</p>

The slides accompanying the open source announcement of the PIA
give the best overview of the benefits of this technology and the
goals of the PIA project. This <a href= 
"http://www.risource.org/PIA/LinuxWorld1999/lw99.slides.html">
presentation</a> was given at the LinuxWorld Conference &amp; Expo,
March 4, 1999. 

<p>The full potential of the PIA will be realized as users and
developers build useful, task oriented applications. The PIA provides a
solid foundation that enables rapid development and customization
of applications. The PIA group has provided a number of example applications to
demonstrate some possibilities. See the <a href="agents.html">Application
Guide</a> for a description of those applications that are currently
available.</p>

<h2><a name="Agency">Working with PIA Agency</a></h2>

<p>The <dfn>PIA Agency</dfn> is a program (e.g. <var>PIA/bin/pia</var>)
that manages a collection of <dfn>applications</dfn>. Those applications
operate on and communicate by means of messages called
<em>transactions</em>. Transactions are of two types: <em>requests</em> and
<em>responses</em>. A response is generated by an application or external
server in reply to some request</p>

<p>An agency can operate on behalf of an individual user, a group
of users, or a peripheral device. Thus an agency can operate
as:</p>

<ul>
<li>a <em>web server</em> handing back documents in response to
requests from a client such as a browser</li>

<li>a <em>client</em> requesting documents from other servers</li>

<li>a <em>proxy</em> passing requests and responses along to the
appropriate servers and clients, and possibly operating on the
documents in the process</li>

     <li>a <em> XML processor</em> which operates on active XML pages and
	  produces other XML (or HTML) pages as output.</li>

</ul>

<p>This versatility opens the door to many possible
applications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Applications can provide standard Web processing functions, like
workgroup applications that manage the processing of purchase
approval, expense reports, and other forms.</li>

<li>Applications can provide process information that comes from other
sources. For example, an application could make it fast and easy for you
to simultaneously download many sound files from a server. The
application first retrieves a page from the web server and processes that
page to include a check box next to every link. The user checks off
the files they want to download and when they submit the form the
application automatically retrieves the specified files without requiring
any further action by the user.</li>

<li>An application can also operate as a <em>personal</em> proxy, which
can keep track of all the documents you view on the web even if you
use different machines to access those documents (e.g., desktop and
laptop systems).</li>
</ul>

<p>Outside the agency, requests and responses are transmitted using
HTTP, a standard, widely used Internet protocol which is
operating-system and programming-language independent.</p>

<p>An agency provides a means of examining, modifying and
re-routing transactions among the various clients and servers. At
times it operates as a client, as a server, as a cache, and as a
proxy server depending upon the task it undertakes. As such, it
provides a new platform for document-oriented computing.</p>

<p> There are broadly two types of applications: (1) passive ones, which act
    like static web pages or CGI scripts, waiting for a specific request and
    responding to it with an HTML page, and (2) active ones, which
    which actively monitor and sometimes modify requests and responses passing
    through the Agency's port. </em>

<h3 id="CEGCDJID"><a name="How">How Active Agencies Work</a></h3>

<em>This section is optional reading for those who just want to use the
agency; it refers to the special type of active application we call "agents".
</em>

<p>Each transaction processed by an agency has a set of named <dfn>
features</dfn> with corresponding values (mostly boolean) which are computed
as needed. Each active application (or agent) has a set of <dfn>criteria</dfn>
that are matched against a transaction's features. Agents that match a
transaction's criteria are allowed to <em>act on it</em>, that is perform
whatever operation the agent is designed to do.</p>

<p>A transaction also has a queue of objects (mainly agents and
transactions) called "satisfiers." After every agent has operated
on a transaction, the agency attempts to <em>satisfy</em> the
transaction by invoking the <code>handle</code> method of each
object in the queue. If none of the methods return <code>
true</code>, the agency performs a default action, generating an
error transaction for an unsatisfied request or forwarding a
response to its destination.</p>

<p> Any passive application can be run by making a request for it via the
    PIA's port, just as a web page or CGI script could be run (unless you
    specifically instruct the PIA to block that application).  But an active
    agent must be deliberately run (or initialized), to be ready to perform
    these monitor-and-modify operations by itself; that setup is
done by means of a document called <code>initialize.xh</code>.
Further information on these files can be found in the document
<em><a href="author.html">Author's Guide</a></em>.</p>

<h2><a name="Applications">Working with Applications</a></h2>

<p>The PIA agency acts as a platform for computing using a
collection of "applications." An application's files are organized as a
"sub-site" of the agency's URL, with each application simply a
collection of documents. These documents can include standard HTML
tagging or make use of an extended set of tags which allows them to
function as <var>active</var> documents.</p>

<p>This section provides a basic introduction to the use of these
applications. For a more advanced examples, see the <a href="/Samples/">
samples applications</a>, which are ready-made for modification and
customization. Additional ideas and inspiration might come from a close look
at the other applications (such as those in the <code>Agents</code> directory)
 that ship with the PIA.</p>

</ul>

<h3><a name="Applications">Applications and Agents</a></h3>

<p> The PIA is called an ``Information Agency'' because it serves as a
    platform for ``information agents'' -- pieces of semi-autonomous code that
    operate behalf of the PIA's user.  For example, each HTTP transaction
    (request or response) that passes through it can be operated on by agents
    whose ``criteria'' match features of the transaction.  Other agents can be
    set to operate at a particular time or time interval.  Some just look for
    requests to particular ``shorthand'' URL's (like <code>~Calendar</code>)
    and redirect them someplace else (like
    <code>Agents/SimpleCalendar</code>).
</p>

<p> Earlier in the PIA's development, <em>every</em> application was
    associated with an agent, so the two terms have come to be used almost
    interchangeably.  This can be seen most clearly in the continued use of
    <code>Agents</code> as the name for the directory that contains the PIA's
    standard set of applications.  Since most applications are associated with
    an agent, and since in any case it's difficult to distinguish those that
    are from those that aren't, the custom continues.
</p>

<p>State maintenance along with the agency framework allows agents
to be more flexible, and much easier to generate and maintain than
traditional web processes such as CGI scripts.</p>

<p> The basis for each application is a location (the application's ``home
    resource'') that contains active XML documents that can include one or
    more:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Standard HTML tags</li>

  <li>Predefined PIA tags</li>

  <li>User defined tags created using the PIA's tag language</li>
</ul>

<p>When an application receives a request for a document, it looks for
the file that matches that request.  Once the file is found, it is
interpreted and the result returned.</p>

<p> For the end user, these files provide a <i>form-based</i> interface for
    interacting with the application.  By convention, active documents are
    given the <tt> .xh</tt> filename extension, reflecting the fact that they
    contain an e<em>x</em>tended set of <em>H</em>TML tags.  The PIA allows
    the user to leave off the extension; this lets the application designer
    hide from the user such details as which files are active and which are
    ordinary HTML.
</p>

<p>The simplest applications consist of a small number of pages where
each page is defined using a combination of HTML, XML and extended
XML tags. There are also a number of predefined PIA tags available
for use. See the <em><a class="Tagsets/basic.html" href= 
"Tagsets/basic.html">Basic Tagset Manual</a></em> for more on these
tags.</p>

<h3><a name="Running"></a>Running an Information Agency</h3>

<p>To run the PIA, it must be <a href= "install.html">installed</a> at your
site.  Even if it has been installed in a shared location, you can customize
your own PIA by means of its configuration file.  </p>

<p>Once it is installed, you can start the PIA by executing the command
<tt><em>PIA_HOME</em>/bin/pia</tt>, where <tt><em>PIA_HOME</em></tt> is the
PIA's ``home directory'' -- the directory it was installed in.  If you
installed it in your home directory, for example, the command to run the PIA
would be:</p>

<pre>
  ~/PIA/bin/pia
</pre>

<p>While the PIA is starting up, you will see a sequence of messages something
like this:
</p>

<pre>
&lt;jaguar:717&gt; ~/PIA/bin/pia
PIA version 2.0.6
    / Loaded system tagset 'pia-config' in 3.70 seconds.
  / Loaded tagset 'pia-xhtml' in 2.67 seconds.
Running initialize.xh in PIA
Admin agent initialized  authenticated with /etc/passwd 
SimpleCalendar agent initialized
Proxie agent initializing
History agent initializing
remoteTools agent initializing
Point your browser to &lt;URL: http://jaguar.crc.ricoh.com:8888&gt;
</pre>

<p>At this point you can browse to the URL specified on the last line. </p>


<h4><a name="viewing"></a>Viewing an Application's Home Page</h4>

<p>As soon as an agency is running, you can view that agency's home
page at <tt><a href="http://localhost:8888/">
http://<i>YOUR.HOST.NAME.HERE</i>:8888/</a></tt>using any
browser.</p>


<p> Or you can visit one of the standard applications (say the calendar) by
    viewing <tt><a
href="http://localhost:8888/Agents/SimpleCalendar/home.xh">SimpleCalendar
</a></tt>, or one of the ready-to-customize sample applications by viewing
<tt><a href="http://localhost:8888/Samples/HelloWorld/home.xh">HelloWorld
</a></tt>.

<p>Notice the URL for this page. If your machine name is jaguar,
you might see the following:</p>

<code>http://jaguar:8888/Samples/HelloWorld/home.xh</code>
<p>Note that the URL for the agency home page has four parts:
<br>
</p>

<ul>
<li><code>http://jaguar:8888</code> represents the machine name and
port number (your Information Agency).</li>

<li><code>Samples</code> represents the directory for this group of
applications </li>

<li><code>HelloWorld</code> represents the particular application you want to
use </li>

<li><code>home.xh</code> represents the particular file in that application
(one active page among possibly many).</li>
</ul>

<p>This URL constitutes a request to the <tt>HelloWorld</tt> application
running on your local Information Agency. </p>

<p>On your agency's home page, you should see a listing of all the
applications currently running on your Information Agency. Click on one
of the application links to see the home page for that application. By default,
your agency is configured to start up with the following
applications:</p>

<ul>
<li><var><a href="/Admin/home.xh">Admin</a></var> is the main application
that manages all other applications</li>

<li><var><var><a name="agent.html#History" href="/History/home.xh">
History</a></var></var> maintains list of visited web pages</li>

<li>The Toolbar agencies

<ul>
<li><var><a href="/fileTools/">fileTools</a></var> adds a control
menu to pages served by your Information Agency</li>

<li><var><a class="agent.html#fbi" href="/remoteTools/">
remoteTools</a></var> adds a control menu to pages proxied through your
agency</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>

<p>These agents are further described in the <em><a href= 
"agents.html">Application Guide</a></em>.</p>

<h4>Installing, Removing or Running Applications</h4>

<p>The PIA home page provides interforms that can be used to
perform basic management of applications including listing, adding and
removing applications.</p>

<p>The application list presents links to an index of all of the
interforms for applications of a given type and to those application's home
pages.</p>

<p>For more information on application installation and customization, see the
<em><a href= "author.html#installing">Author's Guide</a></em>.</p>

<h2><a name="invoke">Pure XML processing</a></h2>

<p>The PIA Document Processor can be invoked stand-alone as a CGI or filter
(formatter) or as part of the PIA. The command for invoking the document
processor as a filter--no network transactions involved--is:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
process <em>[option]...</em> <em>input_filename</em>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>The command-line options are:</p>

<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>-e</code></dt>

<dd>Do not define standard entities.</dd>

<dt><code>-h</code></dt>

<dd>Print a help string.</dd>

<dt><code>-o <em>filename</em></code></dt>

<dd>Specify output file.</dd>

<dt><code>-p</code></dt>

<dd>Build a parse tree (which is output as a serialized Java
object)</dd>

<dt><code>-t <em>tagset-name</em></code></dt>

<dd>Specify tagset (default <code>xhtml</code>).</dd>

<dt><code>-s</code></dt>

<dd>Silent. Non-fatal error messages are suppressed.</dd>

<dt><code>-q</code></dt>

<dd>Quiet. Warnings and informational messages are suppressed.</dd>

<dt><code>-v</code></dt>

<dd>Verbose. Additional informational messages are output.</dd>

<dt><code>-d</code></dt>

<dd>Debugging. Information is output which may be of use for
debugging the interpreter.</dd>
</dl>

<p>For example, a possible start up command is:</p>

<blockquote><code>process -t xxml home.xh</code></blockquote>
