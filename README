README: Platform for Information Applications (PIA) release 2.0
===================================================

This is the initial open source release of the PIA: a framework for quickly
and easily developing web-based document processing systems.  Release 2.0 is
usable, but is intended mainly for software developers helping to create the
core software.  As the code matures, future releases will include more
examples and support for people using the PIA to create information
applications.

The PIA is OPEN SOURCE, you can use it as you like.  Modifications that you
distribute to others must be made publically available.  See the license at 
http://www.RiSource.org/RPL (or the file LICENSE in this directory) for
details.  

For information on installing and using the PIA, see the files in the Doc
directory (install.html and intro.html). 

The latest information can be obtained from http://www.RiSource.org/PIA/
